wav48/p225/p225_001.wav|Please call Stella.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|0,,
wav48/p225/p225_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|0,,
wav48/p225/p225_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|0,,
wav48/p225/p225_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|0,,
wav48/p225/p225_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|0,,
wav48/p225/p225_025.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_026.wav|How are you, sir ?|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_027.wav|So is that it, then ?|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_028.wav|Do I have a favourite ?|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_029.wav|What do we do ?|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_030.wav|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_033.wav|It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_035.wav|A hostile bid is prevented for another nine months.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_036.wav|It was a close call.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_037.wav|In fact, they are the future of investment.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_038.wav|Diving is no part of football.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_039.wav|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_040.wav|You'd better believe it.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_044.wav|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_045.wav|People were determined to change the Government in the last election.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_046.wav|No details of the talks were given.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_049.wav|I have learned from him.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_051.wav|We are committed to the ban.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_052.wav|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_053.wav|I have made that offer.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_054.wav|Four other charges were dropped.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_056.wav|Clearly, it can go either way.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_057.wav|However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_058.wav|However, the problem is the timing.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_059.wav|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_060.wav|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_061.wav|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_062.wav|I was very pleased with them today, though.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_063.wav|Both sides have been hit by injury.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_064.wav|It could take some time.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_065.wav|There is no pressure on us.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_066.wav|It is a job creation scheme.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_067.wav|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_070.wav|That is bound to happen.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_071.wav|He is in the queue.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_072.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_073.wav|So, did she meet him ?|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_081.wav|I had no intention of misleading anyone.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_082.wav|That view is held by many others within the industry.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_083.wav|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_084.wav|He is delighted, and he has every right to be.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_086.wav|In fact, he should never have been in the field.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_089.wav|Officers recovered a second body in the area.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_090.wav|I did not have a bet on myself.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_092.wav|There is a contract in existence for Allan.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_094.wav|That's as it should be.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_103.wav|Everyone deserves to share in this success.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_104.wav|His is a success story by any standard.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_108.wav|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_109.wav|That might help a bit.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_110.wav|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_111.wav|It isn't a happy memory.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_113.wav|The big issue for us is the review.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_114.wav|I told him I was a long time ago.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_115.wav|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_116.wav|Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_117.wav|We have no influence on the Government's policy on the euro.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_118.wav|We suffered a lot for seven years.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_120.wav|The industry is not well organised.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_121.wav|You get a lot for your money.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_122.wav|I didn't feel under any pressure.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_123.wav|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_124.wav|As for the warning, it was not needed.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_126.wav|The squad is too small.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_127.wav|It is a common problem.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_128.wav|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_131.wav|Another High Street retailer was not so lucky.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_133.wav|I think he's the favourite.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_135.wav|We have seen a copy of the report.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_136.wav|But the Commission is on a collision course with the Government.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_141.wav|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_142.wav|Well, you can have a tree.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_143.wav|Russell did not appeal the committee's decision.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_144.wav|She will do for me.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_145.wav|Why change it ?|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_147.wav|Does the name matter ?|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_149.wav|Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_150.wav|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_151.wav|Nothing has been put into action.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_152.wav|The weather forecast isn't good.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_153.wav|We have a clean bill of health.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_156.wav|I would like to see the figures for the second quarter.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_157.wav|He was asked to quit.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_158.wav|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_159.wav|Neither side can win this war.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_165.wav|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_166.wav|Like last month, it is simply too early to make a call.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_169.wav|Irvine said his company was intent on supporting the Scottish dairy industry.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_171.wav|The report was criticised by the Scottish Consumer Council.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_172.wav|Nobody did in those days.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_173.wav|But the story of the play is worth a play in itself.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_174.wav|He was a big influence on our decision to make this show.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_175.wav|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_176.wav|Treatment is not an issue with these people.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_177.wav|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_179.wav|They know no other way.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_182.wav|We are just glad to be alive.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_191.wav|People will ask about us.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_192.wav|However, this idea is never developed.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_193.wav|It's very difficult to find a buyer.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_195.wav|It is hard to tell.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_196.wav|I think, therefore I am ?|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_197.wav|Who was she ?|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_199.wav|And they were being paid ?|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_200.wav|It looked like a river.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_201.wav|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_202.wav|The occasion was the New Labour conference in Brighton last year.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_203.wav|They have the cash and the fire power.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_208.wav|You are a great player.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_210.wav|Scotland will play its part.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_211.wav|He added that he was very sad about O Neill.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_212.wav|After that nothing could save him.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_218.wav|We used to live with dignity in our country.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_219.wav|They did not attack the themes of the book.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_220.wav|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_221.wav|It's all change at Kilmarnock.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_222.wav|In each case they were a goal down.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_223.wav|The police have an awful lot to explain.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_224.wav|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_225.wav|It is good for our team.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_235.wav|I always felt that I was in control of the match.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_236.wav|That will be the criteria for the future.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_237.wav|Frankly, we were lucky to get second.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_238.wav|Paterson can afford to be generous.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_239.wav|In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_240.wav|We are in the hat.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_241.wav|Well, they were the unlucky ones.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_242.wav|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_243.wav|The irony was not lost.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_244.wav|What was the matter for concern ?|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_248.wav|Does that put pressure on us ?|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_253.wav|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_254.wav|The problem was a social problem.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_257.wav|My son was too young to die.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_258.wav|We were not allowed to go to help them.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_264.wav|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_265.wav|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_266.wav|No other vehicle was involved in the crash.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_268.wav|I realised I was lucky to have it.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_273.wav|He has not created a Festival resource.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_274.wav|We have not reached the point of no return.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_275.wav|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_276.wav|He will make an excellent chief inspector.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_277.wav|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_279.wav|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_280.wav|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_281.wav|They were not at the property yesterday.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_282.wav|It was at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_285.wav|We have to break that cycle.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_286.wav|I wanted to change the formula.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_287.wav|She said the charity would continue to monitor the case.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_289.wav|Motherwell have no such good fortune.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_290.wav|Scotch beef is badly missed.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_291.wav|We would hope to make progress on that next year.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_293.wav|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_294.wav|However, we had no failures in our side.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_295.wav|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_296.wav|It goes back a long way.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_297.wav|Innocent people have a right to live in safety.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_298.wav|It was deployed in the Gulf War.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_299.wav|They had to learn to work from the consumer back.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_300.wav|I can hardly believe it.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_301.wav|I must do something about it.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_302.wav|Three hours later, the man was free.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_303.wav|And it had been a marvellous occasion.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_305.wav|Cast Away now on general release.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_308.wav|I thought his speech was a disgrace.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_309.wav|Are they free ?|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_310.wav|What are they for ?|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_312.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_314.wav|We believe the world has too many refugees already.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_315.wav|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_316.wav|It is beyond the government to deal with this tragedy.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_317.wav|At the moment, it is very difficult to know.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_318.wav|The problem was he thought you were a big man.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_319.wav|There's still a bit to go.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_320.wav|We have a good healthy debate.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_322.wav|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_323.wav|It is a court case.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_324.wav|There is no plan B.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_325.wav|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_326.wav|He will go a long way.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_328.wav|It is just a tax on employment.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_329.wav|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_330.wav|We are a peaceful people.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_331.wav|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_332.wav|It's difficult to predict the future.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_334.wav|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_335.wav|We are in the end game.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_336.wav|I came into this world with nothing.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_337.wav|But they have the sound.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_346.wav|It wasn't a flight of fancy.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_347.wav|Boy is the town a mess.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_348.wav|Does it matter ?|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_349.wav|How do you take them away ?|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_350.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?|0,,
wav48/p225/p225_351.wav|After the match, do you ?|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_352.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_353.wav|THE pain was almost too much to bear.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_354.wav|This action reflects a slump in bookings.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_355.wav|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_356.wav|I said he was set to retire.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_357.wav|It is a sign of hope.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_358.wav|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.|0,,,
wav48/p225/p225_359.wav|But we welcome this document.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_363.wav|There is The Beautiful Game to write.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_365.wav|You did not see it.|0,,,,
wav48/p225/p225_366.wav|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.|0,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_001.wav|Please call Stella. |1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |1,,
wav48/p226/p226_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |1,,,

wav48/p226/p226_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |1,,
wav48/p226/p226_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |1,,
wav48/p226/p226_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|1,,
wav48/p226/p226_025.wav|He has not been named.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_026.wav|That's no bad thing.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_027.wav|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_028.wav|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_029.wav|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_030.wav|Because we do not need it.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_031.wav|This is the window.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_032.wav|I was an athlete.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_033.wav|From that day on we started to look for another full back.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_034.wav|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_036.wav|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_037.wav|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_039.wav|It has failed.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_040.wav|It was clear.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_041.wav|It is not for any other purpose.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_042.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.|1,,
wav48/p226/p226_043.wav|Is there a new way forward?|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_044.wav|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_045.wav|This represents a tough game for us.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_046.wav|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_047.wav|We need to chat.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_048.wav|It's a blessing.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_049.wav|But it might have done.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_050.wav|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_051.wav|It has been a horrible, horrible time.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_052.wav|It is the whole package.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_053.wav|He had no enemies.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_054.wav|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_055.wav|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_056.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.|1,,
wav48/p226/p226_057.wav|It's the big omission.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_058.wav|Next league matches Celtic.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_059.wav|She's a spy!|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_060.wav|It is unique.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_061.wav|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_062.wav|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_063.wav|It's a real challenge.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_064.wav|It is not great art.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_065.wav|You do not change overnight.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_066.wav|Art is extra.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_067.wav|It's a matter of balance.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_068.wav|Scotland had great assets.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_069.wav|I've spent a lot of time on buses.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_070.wav|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_071.wav|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_072.wav|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_073.wav|The script was funny.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_074.wav|You need a trademark.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_075.wav|Painful, but only because it's true.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_076.wav|Help is needed.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_077.wav|Tommy is not a problem.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_078.wav|There could be a way back.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_079.wav|Neither it is.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_080.wav|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_082.wav|It is a terrible place.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_083.wav|It works for us.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_084.wav|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_085.wav|It can be halted.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_086.wav|This is the way things should be handled.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_088.wav|Detection is often difficult.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_089.wav|He seems to be pleased with the picture.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_090.wav|New Zealand rugby is totally different.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_091.wav|Someone who cares|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_092.wav|It's just awful.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_093.wav|It's never too late.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_094.wav|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_095.wav|That will come after the game on Saturday.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_096.wav|However, it did not end that way.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_097.wav|We could not get any possession.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_098.wav|If you could find it.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_099.wav|He is hungry for success and I am the same.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_100.wav|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_101.wav|It was mayhem.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_102.wav|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_103.wav|They were outside the circle.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_104.wav|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_105.wav|May not have been at fault?|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_106.wav|It was some time before she found out he was safe.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_107.wav|It was a good performance.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_108.wav|That time is not now, however.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_109.wav|Oil embargo endorsed.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_110.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_111.wav|It was an adventure.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_112.wav|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_113.wav|The Prime Minister was very saddened to hear about this.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_114.wav|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_115.wav|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_116.wav|It is normal.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_117.wav|I don't have many friends.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_118.wav|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_119.wav|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_120.wav|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_121.wav|Maybe this battle has been.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_122.wav|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_124.wav|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_125.wav|She's got to say something.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_126.wav|It is a delight on every level.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_127.wav|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_128.wav|I felt very strongly that England should have it.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_129.wav|She has been shot.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_130.wav|I thought it was a fantastic game.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_131.wav|I was furious.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_132.wav|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_133.wav|She really suffered for her art.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_134.wav|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_135.wav|I do not think this family will ever get over this.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_136.wav|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_137.wav|It will be too hot.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_138.wav|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_139.wav|I am now unemployed.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_140.wav|They made such decisions in London.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_141.wav|Our intentions are real.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_142.wav|Government will intervene.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_143.wav|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_144.wav|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_145.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_146.wav|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_148.wav|Three penalties were given.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_149.wav|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_150.wav|We just had a go.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_151.wav|We have seen a copy of the report.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_152.wav|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_153.wav|That group reported just before Christmas.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_154.wav|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_155.wav|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_156.wav|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_157.wav|Alain Baxter did not have long to speak on Friday.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_158.wav|We will turn the corner.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_159.wav|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_160.wav|They should stop the bombing.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_161.wav|These days are long gone.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_162.wav|It is an attitude of mind.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_163.wav|I've learned from my mistakes.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_164.wav|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_165.wav|We have to move forward.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_166.wav|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_167.wav|They will do their own thing.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_168.wav|It is too much for me.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_169.wav|Nobody did in those days.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_171.wav|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_172.wav|It became a book by itself.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_173.wav|His team management was protective.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_174.wav|It's quite a routine.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_175.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_176.wav|If that's the case, he will struggle.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_177.wav|I took the gun.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_178.wav|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_179.wav|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_180.wav|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_181.wav|I've been there.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_183.wav|I have no sympathy with her at all.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_184.wav|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_185.wav|It is not fair.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_186.wav|It just came into my head that day.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_187.wav|I had a train to catch.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_188.wav|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_189.wav|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_190.wav|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_191.wav|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_192.wav|People will ask about us.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_193.wav|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_194.wav|It is a case of taking a risk.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_195.wav|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.|1,,
wav48/p226/p226_197.wav|There was no option.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_198.wav|Is that it?|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_199.wav|We live by the rule of law.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_200.wav|Is that success?|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_201.wav|The service from the other players was super.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_202.wav|They are in the euro.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_203.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_204.wav|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_205.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.|1,,
wav48/p226/p226_206.wav|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_207.wav|It's a mixture of everything.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_208.wav|I don't want to use it.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_209.wav|Now, it's all right.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_210.wav|It's like a garage.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_211.wav|But I am a worried man.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_212.wav|They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_213.wav|Feel the heat?|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_214.wav|I'm pleased about one thing.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_215.wav|I am delighted for Simon.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_216.wav|His third goal was superb.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_217.wav|It's not ideal.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_218.wav|I was so nervous.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_219.wav|I might come back.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_220.wav|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_221.wav|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_223.wav|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_224.wav|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_225.wav|A career as a doctor is on hold.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_226.wav|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_227.wav|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_228.wav|I am immensely sad.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_229.wav|I'd never seen a play about me.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_230.wav|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_231.wav|The track is currently covered in snow.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_232.wav|My wife and family are the support system.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_233.wav|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_234.wav|Stewart will travel with some confidence.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_235.wav|Police later said the scheme would end in November.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_236.wav|It is set in Paris.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_237.wav|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_238.wav|Hospitals are for the ill.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_239.wav|It would still have been a good film, but very different.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_240.wav|She is well balanced.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_241.wav|They are all bright and different.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_242.wav|It's only fair.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_243.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_244.wav|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_245.wav|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_246.wav|His body was never found.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_247.wav|We did not compete with any other local farmer.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_248.wav|I was shocked.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_249.wav|I should think so, too.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_251.wav|There's the mix.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_252.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_253.wav|I was never going to play against Scotland.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_254.wav|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_255.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_256.wav|Blair is very positive at European Councils.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_257.wav|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.|1,,
wav48/p226/p226_258.wav|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_259.wav|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_260.wav|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_261.wav|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_262.wav|Today we can say that a new era has begun.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_263.wav|I would have the hammer in the crowd.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_264.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_265.wav|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_266.wav|The warning is timely.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_267.wav|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.|1,,
wav48/p226/p226_268.wav|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_269.wav|They are never here.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_270.wav|We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_271.wav|He was popular.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_272.wav|Frankly, we should all have such problems.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_273.wav|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_274.wav|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_276.wav|It's a way of life.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_278.wav|I feel pretty good.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_279.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_280.wav|He has a wealth of experience.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_281.wav|It happens from time to time.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_283.wav|He looked very sharp.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_284.wav|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_285.wav|It was a virus.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_286.wav|Yet, it worked.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_287.wav|Who will perform?|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_288.wav|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_289.wav|This is a national crisis.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_290.wav|Scotland were beaten again.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_291.wav|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_292.wav|It goes back a long way.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_293.wav|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_294.wav|The results are sometimes contentious.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_295.wav|He should have won.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_296.wav|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_297.wav|There's a pause.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_298.wav|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_299.wav|There was no hint of scandal.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_300.wav|I thought it was my only chance.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_301.wav|However, the snow was welcomed by some.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_302.wav|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_303.wav|One was a lawyer.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_304.wav|Our task is to complete the picture.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_305.wav|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_306.wav|We believe the world has too many refugees already.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_307.wav|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_308.wav|This is a war over our home.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_309.wav|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_310.wav|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_311.wav|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_312.wav|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_313.wav|The minister is the engineer.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_314.wav|I did not name it.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_315.wav|It was a question of patience.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_316.wav|The whole region is in shock.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_317.wav|It's about my time as a guitarist.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_318.wav|Kids are terrible.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_319.wav|Craig is a major concern for us.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_320.wav|The home team had an amazing start.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_321.wav|My body is clearly capable.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_322.wav|Referees are easy targets.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_323.wav|He said she was mad.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_324.wav|We are in the end game.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_325.wav|I am very happy to be here.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_326.wav|The airport was even different.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_327.wav|We do the same.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_328.wav|That's the law of the land.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_329.wav|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_330.wav|The weekly average was three hours.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_331.wav|Donald was his friend.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_332.wav|I am so upset.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_333.wav|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_334.wav|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_335.wav|The boat was fantastic.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_336.wav|It is a time bomb.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_337.wav|I'd like to take the plunge.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_338.wav|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_339.wav|My view has now completely changed.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_340.wav|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_341.wav|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_342.wav|Three years ago he would have been.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_343.wav|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_344.wav|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_345.wav|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_346.wav|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_347.wav|It was his conclusion that they were generally in good condition.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_348.wav|Look at the witnesses.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_349.wav|He's been the key to everything.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_350.wav|That is the very reason why it was so vital.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_351.wav|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_352.wav|His contract was then not renewed.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_353.wav|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_354.wav|That is a break with tradition.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_355.wav|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_356.wav|She is free.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_357.wav|I kept going for her.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_358.wav|You must have a government and a good civil service.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_359.wav|He's very explosive.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_360.wav|No other job in world football can compare to this one.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_361.wav|Our numbers are small.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_362.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_363.wav|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_364.wav|This is a club on the rise.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_365.wav|I have got a wife to feed.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_366.wav|It's not pretty, but it's effective.|1,,,
wav48/p226/p226_367.wav|Equity declined to comment.|1,,,,
wav48/p226/p226_368.wav|All the investment is possible through the public sector.|1,,,,

wav48/p226/p226_370.wav|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.|1,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_001.wav|Please call Stella. |2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |2,,
wav48/p227/p227_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |2,,
wav48/p227/p227_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |2,,
wav48/p227/p227_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection in the sun's rays by the rain. |2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |2,,
wav48/p227/p227_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|2,,
wav48/p227/p227_025.wav|Meetings will also remain private.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_026.wav|Movement has to take place.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_027.wav|I feel I did not have enough time.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_028.wav|We will look into it.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_029.wav|This is a central issue.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_030.wav|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_031.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_032.wav|There, you were just a body.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_033.wav|It is not for any other purpose.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_034.wav|President Bush is at war.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_035.wav|I became a widow overnight.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_036.wav|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_037.wav|This represents a tough game for us.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_038.wav|She hopes to study in Britain one day.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_039.wav|Among them are many criminals.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_040.wav|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_041.wav|He looks like an Afghan.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_042.wav|It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_043.wav|I'd come back from London.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_044.wav|If I was a woman.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_045.wav|He was a home referee.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_046.wav|There was no safety net.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_047.wav|The casting of her husband was an accident.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_048.wav|We have to look beyond the very short term.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_049.wav|I expect a rapid response.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_050.wav|That is very hard, alone.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_051.wav|The motive for the shooting was not known.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_052.wav|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_053.wav|Four other charges were dropped.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_054.wav|I could not do it.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_055.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_056.wav|How are you, sir ?|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_057.wav|So is that it, then ?|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_058.wav|Do I have a favourite ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_059.wav|What do we do ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_060.wav|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_061.wav|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_062.wav|They have to come up with a solution.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_063.wav|We will pay their bills.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_064.wav|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.|2,,
wav48/p227/p227_065.wav|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_066.wav|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_067.wav|I have proved that in the past.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_068.wav|He had been a singer.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_069.wav|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_070.wav|Then followed a bout of flu.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_071.wav|Both sides have been hit by injury.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_072.wav|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_073.wav|It is a terrible place.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_074.wav|Even the one she loved.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_075.wav|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_076.wav|There may be reasons for it.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_077.wav|I first met him last summer.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_078.wav|Last week, he was taken into hospital.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_079.wav|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_080.wav|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.|2,,
wav48/p227/p227_081.wav|By then, he was walking on water.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_082.wav|We have to offer value for money.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_083.wav|They lived for their children.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_084.wav|Potions said he would drive.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_085.wav|The latter is due to be finished in February.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_086.wav|This is a complex and detailed report.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_087.wav|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_088.wav|We will deal with the refugees.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_089.wav|You might not make it.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_090.wav|It is open season on the Old Firm.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_091.wav|That is the important thing.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_092.wav|For once, you should believe the hype.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_093.wav|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_094.wav|Their attitude is all wrong.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_095.wav|You are like an animal.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_096.wav|No, the equipment is extra.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_097.wav|The following are the principal provisions.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_098.wav|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_099.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_100.wav|I had a fortunate war.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_101.wav|I did not see any reason to change the captain.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_102.wav|Saddam Hussein is a devil.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_103.wav|It was never a starter.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_104.wav|And the match was not too bad, either.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_105.wav|Such actions are rarely popular.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_106.wav|It is safe in our hands.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_107.wav|Then came the farewell to Europe.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_108.wav|It is much as it has been described.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_109.wav|You can spend money on housing.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_110.wav|That admission is not surprising.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_111.wav|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_112.wav|It has removed a bit of guilt.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_113.wav|However, we have to be cautious.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_114.wav|But we could only help a handful of people.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_116.wav|It is just a tax on employment.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_117.wav|This should begin in October.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_118.wav|My life has changed a lot.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_119.wav|We did what we had to do.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_120.wav|Why do it otherwise ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_121.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_122.wav|So, did she meet him ?|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_123.wav|So what is the campaign about ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_124.wav|And does it ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_125.wav|You've got to be vigilant.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_126.wav|We are amazed that the current trading figures were so weak.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_127.wav|Any success would have been an improvement.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_128.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_129.wav|And I have some advice for my old friend.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_130.wav|He is a great addition to our team.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_131.wav|However, this move is dependent upon the sale of the existing site.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_132.wav|I felt he was excellent.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_133.wav|They could use a boost.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_134.wav|It is a vicious circle.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_135.wav|We could easily have lost that game.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_136.wav|This is a limited market.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_137.wav|Our position is quite simple.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_138.wav|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_139.wav|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_140.wav|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_141.wav|He's not a Celtic man.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_142.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_143.wav|So I got a blood test.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_144.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_145.wav|These men are a part of India.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_146.wav|Like the others, he was arrested.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_147.wav|There's only one team in Ayrshire.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_148.wav|It was deployed in the Gulf War.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_149.wav|That was the difference between the sides.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_150.wav|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_151.wav|I was shaking on the blocks.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_152.wav|She had gone to the Catholic school.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_153.wav|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.|2,,
wav48/p227/p227_154.wav|The strong pound also took its toll.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_155.wav|It was a funny feeling.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_156.wav|I'd love to be like Peter.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_157.wav|Adams is surely worth a chance.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_158.wav|It is difficult to say.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_159.wav|He was in great spirits.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_160.wav|Seven people were later detained by police.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_161.wav|They want to see him.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_162.wav|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_163.wav|Nobody did in those days.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_164.wav|There is no signature on this document.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_165.wav|We've made a couple of albums.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_166.wav|What happened in that game ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_167.wav|Are you going to win ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_168.wav|Was it the wife ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_169.wav|Why change it ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_170.wav|What do we want to do that for ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_171.wav|The people are the hero.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_172.wav|One season, they might do well.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_173.wav|They made such decisions in London.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_174.wav|The second aspect was the fear of failure.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_175.wav|The jury is still out.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_176.wav|But he has a lifeline.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_177.wav|The expansions will be financed by the Clydesdale Bank.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_178.wav|I'm just going to hit the shot.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_179.wav|It makes no influence on the public.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_180.wav|That will apply to both sets of fans.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_181.wav|I think it's a good sign.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_183.wav|I have spoken to head office.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_184.wav|Well, you can have a tree.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_186.wav|They bought the property four years ago.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_187.wav|He is believed to live in Britain.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_188.wav|We've just had it confirmed.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_189.wav|A copy of the report will be sent to them.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_190.wav|This is the time to use it.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_191.wav|You know the sort of thing.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_192.wav|They were seriously after him.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_193.wav|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_194.wav|Trading conditions have not been that bad.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_195.wav|I'm interested in interesting work.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_196.wav|It will be reviewed in The Herald tomorrow.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_197.wav|The force is with them.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_198.wav|If the director is with you.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_199.wav|He made no order on costs.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_200.wav|I guess I was lucky, though.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_201.wav|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_203.wav|It was served by sheriff officers.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_204.wav|This will be our new beginning.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_205.wav|They have the cash and the fire power.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_206.wav|My heart is with the artist.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_207.wav|That might mean another delay.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_208.wav|However, it is not as simple as this.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_209.wav|The sanctions are about collective punishment.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_210.wav|This is a holy place.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_211.wav|Does the name matter ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_212.wav|how do you get it back ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_213.wav|What are you not good at ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_214.wav|I think, therefore I am ?|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_215.wav|Who was she ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_216.wav|You have caught a serial killer.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_217.wav|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_218.wav|The move follows a review of the Singapore|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_219.wav|They make a selective perception process.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_220.wav|There is no quick fix.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_222.wav|They have known the hard times.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_223.wav|That might help a bit.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_226.wav|I'm just a regular person.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_227.wav|My daughter is an adult.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_228.wav|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_229.wav|It's just a normal life.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_230.wav|He must get to know himself.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_231.wav|And the World Cup has not even begun.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_232.wav|He remains a main board director of Royal.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_233.wav|The fight is under way.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_235.wav|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_236.wav|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_237.wav|We can certainly build on this.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_238.wav|William Hague delighted his party.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_239.wav|There is a world of difference.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_240.wav|We played them off the pitch.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_241.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_242.wav|I can't wait to meet him.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_243.wav|My wife and family are the support system.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_244.wav|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_245.wav|It is the voice of the survivors.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_246.wav|She died in middle age.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_247.wav|It is set in Paris.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_248.wav|You will have seen the adverts.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_249.wav|It is possible to be too good.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_250.wav|Moreover, it must be for all sports.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_251.wav|They were in the wrong place at the wrong time.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_252.wav|The irony was not lost.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_253.wav|Three weeks later, he resigned.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_254.wav|It is a court case.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_255.wav|It might be sad, but it's a fact.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_256.wav|She took them for a term.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_257.wav|Kingfisher can afford to wait.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_258.wav|Nato was not a love affair.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_259.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_260.wav|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_261.wav|You can feel at home in China.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_262.wav|Our decision making was poor.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_263.wav|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_264.wav|The baby deserves the credit.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_265.wav|And they were being paid ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_266.wav|Was everything done to save people ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_267.wav|What was the matter for concern ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_268.wav|Do I think about them often ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_269.wav|Is it in the right place ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_270.wav|Did he trip ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_271.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_272.wav|I should think so, too.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_273.wav|No production contract is yet in sight.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_274.wav|The capital costs are modest.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_275.wav|This is no reflection on Rangers.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_276.wav|I told you I was ill.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_277.wav|I can't get a job.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_278.wav|That could be in place by next year.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_279.wav|On the contrary they stand to gain.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_280.wav|Blair is very positive at European Councils.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_281.wav|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_282.wav|It does not work that way in Scottish football.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_283.wav|Every one is a winner.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_284.wav|There's not much money in cycling.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_285.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_286.wav|Not many companies can say that these days.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_287.wav|They can leave at any time.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_288.wav|You get a lot for your money.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_289.wav|As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_290.wav|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_291.wav|It was an easy decision to come here.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_292.wav|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_293.wav|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_294.wav|But the plot is not the point.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_295.wav|It was never a free kick.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_296.wav|My body is a wreck.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_297.wav|It's called the Supreme Court for a reason.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_298.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_299.wav|She failed in her action.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_300.wav|Stephen will get his first cap.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_301.wav|It's hard to see it.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_302.wav|Her appeal is to be heard this week.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_303.wav|We have to be very, very careful.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_304.wav|The partnership was set up during the summer.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_305.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_306.wav|It is an amazing response.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_307.wav|Size is not the issue.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_308.wav|He will address the nation this evening.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_309.wav|We have the easy part.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_310.wav|We are not increasing the number.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_311.wav|I'm looking for work in Bath and back home in Scotland.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_312.wav|They do not reflect the quality of the brand.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_313.wav|It could well be military.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_314.wav|And that culture is everywhere in Dublin.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_315.wav|His job was not advertised.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_316.wav|This is a big step up.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_317.wav|It goes back a long way.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_318.wav|The weather forecast isn't good.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_319.wav|We have a clean bill of health.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_320.wav|In that case, the children were not missing.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_321.wav|I have got a victim.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_322.wav|The judge was really nice.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_323.wav|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_324.wav|McNaughton was not so sure.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_326.wav|The dealer is on notice.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_327.wav|It is hoped to complete the merger in the summer.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_328.wav|The party lasted all night.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_329.wav|He would help me with the form.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_330.wav|There's still a bit to go.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_331.wav|I'm not worried about the critics.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_332.wav|I would do away with the dress code.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_333.wav|It is so easy to be negative.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_334.wav|What form did that take ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_335.wav|Are they free ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_336.wav|What are they for ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_337.wav|Is there a waiting list ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_338.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_339.wav|So what happens next ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_340.wav|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_341.wav|I am not obsessed with sex.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_342.wav|Have a look at this lot.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_343.wav|That decision will be made over the next couple of days.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_344.wav|Public opinion was split on the proposal.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_345.wav|The king is delighted by the honour.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_347.wav|I've got a sense of humour, too.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_348.wav|In the old days, it was easy.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_349.wav|I came into this world with nothing.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_350.wav|This is a trend which will be encouraged.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_351.wav|There will have to be a full inquiry.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_352.wav|There was no time scale.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_353.wav|In his absence, the council adopted the change.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_354.wav|Whether this return was too soon.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_355.wav|The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_356.wav|They were the acts of men.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_357.wav|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_358.wav|Of course, we want to go home.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_359.wav|I am very interested in the subject.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_360.wav|He is not very big, either.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_361.wav|A report is expected next month.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_363.wav|We are encouraged by the news.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_364.wav|Had this been common practice ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_365.wav|What do they want us to do ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_366.wav|Is it worth it ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_367.wav|Does it matter ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_368.wav|A crucial moment has arrived.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_369.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_370.wav|We need to be prepared.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_371.wav|Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_372.wav|His views are hardly surprising.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_373.wav|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_374.wav|It has been made to entertain.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_375.wav|It is a stroke of genius.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_376.wav|Italy was just behind the US.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_377.wav|It was forced to divert.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_378.wav|Alex Ferguson is the same.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_379.wav|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_380.wav|We are still getting over it.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_382.wav|This will impact on us.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_383.wav|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_384.wav|He is in the queue.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_385.wav|The salary changes are long overdue.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_386.wav|I do not like to lose.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_387.wav|I am a member of the Labour Party staff.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_388.wav|There is no deal as yet.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_389.wav|In due course the deal was done.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_390.wav|Celtic were pleased to help.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_391.wav|They will fight for everything.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_392.wav|That's not like us at all.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_393.wav|You have to rely on each other.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_394.wav|I wanted to go out on a high.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_395.wav|I felt the head was very like me.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_396.wav|It is a terrible equation.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_397.wav|They have not got anyone.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_398.wav|I can hardly believe it.|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_399.wav|How do you take them away ?|2,,,,
wav48/p227/p227_400.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?|2,,
wav48/p227/p227_401.wav|After the match, do you ?|2,,,
wav48/p227/p227_402.wav|Persuaded to change his mind.|2,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_001.wav|Please call Stella.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|3,,
wav48/p228/p228_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|3,,
wav48/p228/p228_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|3,,
wav48/p228/p228_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|3,,
wav48/p228/p228_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|3,,
wav48/p228/p228_025.wav|It's nice to hear.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_026.wav|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_027.wav|Because we do not need it.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_028.wav|There's a story, too.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_029.wav|I feel I did not have enough time.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_030.wav|Life was like a timetable.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_031.wav|He took me on a tour of the wards.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_032.wav|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_033.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_034.wav|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_035.wav|It was clear.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_036.wav|The problem is the pitch.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_037.wav|Indeed, he does.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_038.wav|President Bush is at war.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_039.wav|She is believed to be in South Africa.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_040.wav|My whole life has changed.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_041.wav|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_042.wav|No meaningful response was issued.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_043.wav|It is urgent.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_044.wav|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.|3,,
wav48/p228/p228_045.wav|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_046.wav|We need to chat.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_047.wav|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_048.wav|The Scottish Parliament is also looking at similar measures.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_049.wav|But it might have done.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_050.wav|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_051.wav|Mary Archer is almost too clever.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_052.wav|He looks like an Afghan.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_053.wav|Here's a clue.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_054.wav|It had been in place since last July.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_055.wav|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_056.wav|That's the day job.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_057.wav|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_058.wav|That's the truth.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_059.wav|That is very hard, alone.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_060.wav|He will now seek to sell his shares in the club.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_061.wav|Four other charges were dropped.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_062.wav|They're appalled by that.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_063.wav|There was a battle there.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_064.wav|Scotland had great assets.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_065.wav|It's that kind of place.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_066.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_067.wav|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_068.wav|And if he hadn't become a musician ?|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_069.wav|He is a young man with a new deal.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_070.wav|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_071.wav|The script was funny.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_072.wav|Try to save us.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_073.wav|Sounds like The Sixth Sense ?|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_074.wav|Painful, but only because it's true.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_075.wav|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_076.wav|It's all I can do.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_077.wav|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_078.wav|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.|3,,
wav48/p228/p228_079.wav|I had my suspicions.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_081.wav|People must remain vigilant.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_082.wav|Today she has been released.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_083.wav|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_084.wav|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_085.wav|But she might be.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_086.wav|Nothing is yet confirmed.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_087.wav|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_088.wav|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_089.wav|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_090.wav|Now the system is right behind us.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_091.wav|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_092.wav|Today I couldn't run on it.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_093.wav|However, it did not end that way.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_094.wav|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_095.wav|Safety was also an issue.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_096.wav|It is an old family habit.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_097.wav|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_098.wav|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_099.wav|It is annoying.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_100.wav|We could not get any possession.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_101.wav|I love the Dome.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_102.wav|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_103.wav|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_104.wav|He is hungry for success and I am the same.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_105.wav|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_106.wav|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_107.wav|It is a good day for the coalition.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_108.wav|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_109.wav|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_110.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_111.wav|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_112.wav|We have an election in eight days.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_113.wav|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_114.wav|They will want to perform well.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_115.wav|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_116.wav|However, they will only be found in the wild.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_117.wav|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_118.wav|Further protests are likely.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_119.wav|It's in his blood.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_120.wav|I don't want to use the term.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_121.wav|The picture is the same across Scotland.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_122.wav|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_123.wav|It is so sad.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_124.wav|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_125.wav|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_126.wav|Who would be a referee ?|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_127.wav|They've got to account for it.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_128.wav|It is a delight on every level.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_129.wav|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_130.wav|Here, again, they were denied a voice.|3,,
wav48/p228/p228_131.wav|I felt very strongly that England should have it.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_132.wav|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_133.wav|This plan is an agenda for action.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_134.wav|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_135.wav|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_136.wav|Offered the gold medal, he declined.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_137.wav|Who will attend ?|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_138.wav|We had a reunion last week.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_139.wav|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_140.wav|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_141.wav|I was the last man to touch the ball.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_142.wav|He was in a great deal of pain.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_143.wav|Nobody in the world can get away from him.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_144.wav|She hopes to study in Britain one day.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_145.wav|Wallace was a prisoner of war.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_146.wav|I think he's the favourite, no question.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_147.wav|Who would be right ?|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_148.wav|It is difficult for Ali.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_149.wav|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.|3,,
wav48/p228/p228_150.wav|Had she enjoyed the experience ?|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_151.wav|That should do it.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_152.wav|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_153.wav|It is not just about pay.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_154.wav|I am just trying to do my job.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_155.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_156.wav|The home side didn't stand a chance.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_157.wav|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_158.wav|The weather forecast isn't good.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_159.wav|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_160.wav|There's a sense of excess in the novel.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_161.wav|We also enjoyed a lot of support.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_162.wav|It was by the numbers.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_163.wav|I was in daily contact.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_164.wav|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_165.wav|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_166.wav|It was so new, so exciting.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_167.wav|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_168.wav|I've put my own money into this project.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_169.wav|Eight months later, he was dead.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_170.wav|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_171.wav|We have to move forward.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_172.wav|By then, however, both men were already in the US.|3,,
wav48/p228/p228_173.wav|We have to sort it out ourselves.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_174.wav|The post will be unpaid.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_175.wav|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_176.wav|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_177.wav|We've made a couple of albums.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_178.wav|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_179.wav|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_180.wav|One season, they might do well.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_181.wav|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_182.wav|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_183.wav|The hotel was now for sale.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_184.wav|I drove the ball well.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_185.wav|I took the gun.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_186.wav|We knew nothing about it.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_187.wav|They will run a mile.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_188.wav|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_189.wav|Mr Marshall is expected to join the council of Europe.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_190.wav|Miller was every bit as happy.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_191.wav|I put the drawing down.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_192.wav|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_193.wav|It was an odd affair, in many respects.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_194.wav|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_195.wav|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_196.wav|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_197.wav|The procedure is the same in all cases.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_198.wav|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_199.wav|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_200.wav|I wanted to put myself on the line.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_202.wav|It's the same old story.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_203.wav|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_204.wav|Is that success ?|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_205.wav|I have a cold.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_206.wav|They are in the euro.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_207.wav|Ferguson should take note.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_208.wav|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_209.wav|Who will pay for this ?|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_210.wav|They've got three-quarters of the way.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_211.wav|He had suffered a heart attack.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_212.wav|A deadline is still essential.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_213.wav|Yet she is still the woman behind the famous man.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_214.wav|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_215.wav|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_216.wav|That will be vital.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_217.wav|Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_218.wav|That is an important part of our role.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_219.wav|She should not be blamed.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_220.wav|I had decided to quit the show.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_221.wav|His third goal was superb.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_222.wav|It's been a good year.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_223.wav|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_224.wav|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_225.wav|Women were mostly notable by their absence.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_226.wav|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_227.wav|Clearly, the stakes are high.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_228.wav|It is a gamble.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_229.wav|It's so special.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_230.wav|You take a risk.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_231.wav|He is severe.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_232.wav|We just had a go.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_233.wav|We are in the hat.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_234.wav|We were a load of rubbish.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_235.wav|Well, they were the unlucky ones.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_236.wav|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_237.wav|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_238.wav|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_239.wav|He claimed the government had lost the plot.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_240.wav|She was well balanced.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_241.wav|It's only fair.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_242.wav|He says that he is no different from any other man.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_243.wav|You can feel at home in China.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_244.wav|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_245.wav|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_246.wav|Washington is consumed by the crisis.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_247.wav|He's a lovely young man.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_248.wav|It was a hit.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_249.wav|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_250.wav|I can't get a job.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_251.wav|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.|3,,
wav48/p228/p228_252.wav|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_253.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_254.wav|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.|3,,
wav48/p228/p228_255.wav|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_256.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_257.wav|Is that a serious question ?|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_258.wav|They are real.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_259.wav|They must play for each other.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_260.wav|I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_261.wav|His contract was then not renewed.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_262.wav|He thought he had a month to cross the street.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_263.wav|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_264.wav|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_265.wav|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_266.wav|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_267.wav|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_268.wav|I was rubbish.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_269.wav|He's been here on numerous occasions.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_270.wav|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.|3,,
wav48/p228/p228_271.wav|It's a way of life.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_272.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_274.wav|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_275.wav|They were too hard.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_276.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_277.wav|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_278.wav|All options are open.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_279.wav|He will address the nation this evening.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_280.wav|We want to see the maximum of change.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_281.wav|Mr Campbell received a phone call.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_282.wav|He was obviously very genuine.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_283.wav|She said she could not believe that they had run away.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_284.wav|It changed my life.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_285.wav|The songs are just so good.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_286.wav|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_287.wav|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_288.wav|It became a book by itself.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_289.wav|The home was now under new management.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_290.wav|Graeme was prepared.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_291.wav|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_292.wav|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_293.wav|Our task is to complete the picture.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_294.wav|They are wrong.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_295.wav|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_296.wav|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_297.wav|You are the glory.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_298.wav|It's certainly different.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_299.wav|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_300.wav|We want to play at the worlds.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_301.wav|We have waited a long time for this.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_302.wav|Is there on his hands ?|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_303.wav|This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_304.wav|It's not even finished.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_305.wav|We are a peaceful people.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_306.wav|Kids are terrible.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_307.wav|The problems began a long time ago.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_308.wav|This film will be totally awesome.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_309.wav|He said she was mad.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_310.wav|There was some merit in that.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_311.wav|I am very happy to be here.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_312.wav|We do the same.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_313.wav|In his absence, the council adopted the change.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_315.wav|It's not long enough.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_316.wav|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_317.wav|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_318.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_319.wav|Is that an issue ?|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_320.wav|My first concern is for the safety of the public.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_321.wav|Robert is a special talent.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_322.wav|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_323.wav|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_324.wav|There was no option.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_325.wav|The same things will happen with GM foods.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_326.wav|It is a sign of hope.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_327.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_328.wav|It has moved on in the last week.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_329.wav|The train was on time.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_330.wav|It is so unfair.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_331.wav|He has to learn.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_332.wav|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_333.wav|I've got no secret.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_334.wav|Tiger is the exception.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_335.wav|A great deal has been achieved.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_336.wav|It was forced to divert.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_337.wav|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_338.wav|This is a friendly match ?|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_339.wav|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_340.wav|He's a genius.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_341.wav|They should take their mobile phones.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_342.wav|It is not like working for a living.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_343.wav|It's the last thing on my mind.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_344.wav|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_345.wav|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_346.wav|That is a break with tradition.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_347.wav|She is free.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_348.wav|Everyone was in tears.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_349.wav|You must have a government and a good civil service.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_350.wav|As, indeed, they would be.|3,,
wav48/p228/p228_351.wav|No other job in world football can compare to this one.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_352.wav|I expected these kind of questions.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_353.wav|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_354.wav|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_355.wav|It's not pretty, but it's effective.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_356.wav|Equity declined to comment.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_357.wav|He later became a respected High Court judge.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_358.wav|The play is based on a real-life event.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_359.wav|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_360.wav|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_361.wav|He put some colour into Scottish history.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_362.wav|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_363.wav|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_364.wav|It is a simple equation.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_365.wav|So there, we won.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_366.wav|But I managed.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_367.wav|By that time, however, it was already too late.|3,,
wav48/p228/p228_368.wav|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_369.wav|There is no signature.|3,,,,
wav48/p228/p228_370.wav|It's a record label, not a form of music.|3,,,
wav48/p228/p228_371.wav|It became a national network.|3,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_001.wav|Please call Stella. |4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |4,,
wav48/p229/p229_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |4,,,
wav48/p229/p229_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |4,,,
wav48/p229/p229_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |4,,
wav48/p229/p229_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |4,,
wav48/p229/p229_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |4,,,
wav48/p229/p229_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |4,,,
wav48/p229/p229_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |4,,,
wav48/p229/p229_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |4,,,
wav48/p229/p229_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |4,,
wav48/p229/p229_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|4,,
wav48/p229/p229_025.wav|Johnson was pretty low.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_026.wav|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_027.wav|It's nice to hear.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_028.wav|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_029.wav|I have a theory.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_030.wav|It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_031.wav|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.|4,,,
wav48/p229/p229_032.wav|Because we do not need it.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_033.wav|And we have a singer.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_034.wav|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_035.wav|It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.|4,,,
wav48/p229/p229_036.wav|I'd like to continue that record.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_037.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.|4,,,
wav48/p229/p229_038.wav|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.|4,,,
wav48/p229/p229_039.wav|They're just different.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_040.wav|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.|4,,
wav48/p229/p229_041.wav|It is not for any other purpose.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_042.wav|He did not know his daughter.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_043.wav|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_044.wav|I was scared.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_045.wav|It will come all right.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_046.wav|But it took a lot of bottle.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_047.wav|But it is all by design.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_048.wav|I am just going to go for it.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_050.wav|We need to chat.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_051.wav|It is difficult for Ali.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_052.wav|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_053.wav|A recording contract is on the horizon.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_054.wav|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.|4,,,
wav48/p229/p229_055.wav|It has been a horrible, horrible time.|4,,,
wav48/p229/p229_056.wav|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_057.wav|She's a spy !|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_058.wav|What was the main difference ?|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_059.wav|My mother is a widow.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_060.wav|And a film maker was born.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_061.wav|Art is extra.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_062.wav|Scotland had great assets.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_063.wav|I've spent a lot of time on buses.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_064.wav|We should have known.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_065.wav|It is like a river running by my home.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_066.wav|Try to save us.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_067.wav|That was the easy election.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_068.wav|I was as strong as a horse.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_069.wav|Ferguson should take note.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_070.wav|The girls are so lucky to be alive.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_071.wav|Neither it is.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_072.wav|She died in hospital two hours later.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_073.wav|It was chaotic.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_074.wav|It is a job creation scheme.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_075.wav|It works for us.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_076.wav|I've not thought about it.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_077.wav|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_078.wav|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_079.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_080.wav|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_081.wav|He seems to be pleased with the picture.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_082.wav|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.|4,,,
wav48/p229/p229_083.wav|Someone who cares|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_084.wav|He can do everything.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_085.wav|By then, he was walking on water.|4,,,
wav48/p229/p229_086.wav|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_087.wav|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.|4,,,
wav48/p229/p229_088.wav|They lived for their children.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_089.wav|It is a lifeline.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_090.wav|However, it did not end that way.|4,,,
wav48/p229/p229_091.wav|We must look forward.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_092.wav|It is an old family habit.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_093.wav|Well, the big day has arrived.|4,,,
wav48/p229/p229_094.wav|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_095.wav|Until you hit the big games.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_096.wav|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_097.wav|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_098.wav|She's got to say something.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_099.wav|He is hungry for success and I am the same.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_100.wav|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_101.wav|She has so much to offer.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_102.wav|The court heard he drove into the path of a car.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_103.wav|It is a good day for the coalition.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_104.wav|We work on the same level.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_105.wav|They were outside the circle.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_106.wav|Two of the team became ill.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_108.wav|I didn't play well last year.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_109.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_110.wav|I'm not depressed.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_111.wav|It is normal.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_112.wav|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_113.wav|I don't have many friends.|4,,,,

wav48/p229/p229_368.wav|I am a star.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_369.wav|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_370.wav|He could make it.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_371.wav|He later became a respected High Court judge.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_373.wav|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.|4,,,
wav48/p229/p229_374.wav|It is not too late to get on board.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_376.wav|It is a simple equation.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_377.wav|Talks are progressing.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_378.wav|They play together perfectly.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_379.wav|It's a long process.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_380.wav|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_381.wav|It does not even have a staff shortage.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_382.wav|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.|4,,,
wav48/p229/p229_384.wav|It is obvious that we are engaged in a war.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_386.wav|Three years ago he would have been.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_387.wav|That team is due to be announced this morning.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_388.wav|It has been a lovely family occasion.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_389.wav|That's the name of the game, though.|4,,,
wav48/p229/p229_390.wav|There were no casualties.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_391.wav|A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.|4,,,,
wav48/p229/p229_392.wav|Yet the data is compelling.|4,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_001.wav|Please call Stella. |5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |5,,
wav48/p230/p230_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |5,,
wav48/p230/p230_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |5,,
wav48/p230/p230_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky. |5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |5,,
wav48/p230/p230_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|5,,
wav48/p230/p230_025.wav|It is on the internet.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_026.wav|Smoking is also very important.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_027.wav|He has the courage of the unaware.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_028.wav|Life was like a timetable.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_029.wav|It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_030.wav|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_031.wav|I'm so happy that she did.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_032.wav|The wedding was in Edinburgh.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_033.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.|5,,
wav48/p230/p230_034.wav|He really is a lovely man.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_035.wav|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_036.wav|This represents a tough game for us.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_037.wav|The boy is no longer with us.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_038.wav|They said she was stable.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_039.wav|This will save interest charges.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_040.wav|Well, he is an artist.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_041.wav|He looks like an Afghan.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_042.wav|People want to see me on the screen.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_043.wav|The big problem is the lack of grass.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_044.wav|That was the theory, anyway.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_045.wav|I was inspired by two things.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_046.wav|If not, he should go home.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_047.wav|I must take a seat.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_048.wav|It was bound to happen.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_049.wav|We have to bring in new players.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_050.wav|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_051.wav|I have made that offer.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_052.wav|None has ever been found.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_053.wav|Four other charges were dropped.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_054.wav|We should be able to cope.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_055.wav|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_056.wav|We will pay their bills.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_057.wav|You should consider whether you want to be in this film.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_058.wav|It was exactly four months away.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_059.wav|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_060.wav|It's not covered by the insurance.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_061.wav|But the challenge is in the US.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_062.wav|Robin Williams is very subdued.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_063.wav|The tournament has now been cancelled.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_064.wav|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_065.wav|Both sides have been hit by injury.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_066.wav|He also received a medal of honour.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_068.wav|It may be that lifestyle is behind it.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_069.wav|It is a job creation scheme.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_070.wav|It looks like a hit.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_071.wav|What do we do ?|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_072.wav|Why do it otherwise ?|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_073.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_074.wav|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_075.wav|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_076.wav|Consumer confidence remains an issue.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_077.wav|Last week, he was taken into hospital.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_078.wav|This is a true story.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_079.wav|By then, he was walking on water.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_080.wav|It's so hard to shift.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_081.wav|They lived for their children.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_083.wav|It might change your life.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_084.wav|You are a great player.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_085.wav|However, it did not end that way.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_086.wav|We will deal with the refugees.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_087.wav|It was not an insult.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_088.wav|You might not make it.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_089.wav|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_090.wav|I did not have a bet on myself.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_091.wav|The conclusion is the same.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_092.wav|He was prepared for this.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_093.wav|But I know the course.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_094.wav|You are like an animal.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_095.wav|We intend to change the model.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_096.wav|It was some time before she found out he was safe.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_097.wav|Two of the team became ill.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_099.wav|It has been a nightmare of frustration.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_100.wav|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_101.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_102.wav|This was a good move for me.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_103.wav|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_104.wav|I was just appalled at the way they behaved.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_105.wav|It is close to call.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_106.wav|It is an impressive record.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_107.wav|It is a total and utter change of culture.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_108.wav|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_109.wav|Abbey National is an option.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_110.wav|The arrival of the Scottish Premier League has also presented a problem.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_112.wav|We have the mental strength.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_113.wav|You can spend money on housing.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_114.wav|That admission is not surprising.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_115.wav|I can't even get into the A team.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_116.wav|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_117.wav|Which can happen any time.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_118.wav|It is too pretty, it is too small.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_119.wav|But this time we can have no excuses.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_120.wav|They are very happy with the new settlement.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_121.wav|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_122.wav|Something will be done by corporate bodies.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_123.wav|We did what we had to do.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_124.wav|She was also very brave.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_125.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_126.wav|We must recognise that this outfit is unique.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_127.wav|The opposite is the case.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_128.wav|He was a home referee.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_129.wav|This is a successful outcome.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_130.wav|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_131.wav|She died at her home.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_132.wav|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.|5,,
wav48/p230/p230_133.wav|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_134.wav|It was a piece of art.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_135.wav|I would relish the prospect.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_137.wav|These men are a part of India.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_138.wav|I was caught out a little bit.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_139.wav|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_140.wav|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_141.wav|It has to be an event.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_142.wav|It was deployed in the Gulf War.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_143.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.|5,,
wav48/p230/p230_144.wav|The first thing is to assess the damage that has been done.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_145.wav|She has gone to the Catholic school.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_146.wav|It was by the numbers.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_147.wav|I am not going to make any further comment, apart from that.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_148.wav|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.|5,,
wav48/p230/p230_149.wav|However, he was later released without charge.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_150.wav|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_151.wav|These days are long gone.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_152.wav|I'm afraid to say anything.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_153.wav|We are still getting over it.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_154.wav|It has to be now.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_155.wav|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_156.wav|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_157.wav|They will do their own thing.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_158.wav|You had to go and see him.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_159.wav|So what is the campaign about ?|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_160.wav|And does it ?|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_161.wav|Are you from the rugby ?|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_162.wav|Had I heard ?|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_163.wav|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_164.wav|Our position remains the same.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_165.wav|Nobody did in those days.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_166.wav|We believe in the medium term.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_167.wav|It's nice to be nice.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_168.wav|To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_169.wav|On the month the weakness was across the board.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_170.wav|One season, they might do well.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_171.wav|Manchester United can win the European Cup this season.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_172.wav|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_173.wav|But he has a lifeline.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_174.wav|Phase one was a shambles.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_175.wav|City sentiment is in his favour.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_176.wav|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_177.wav|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_178.wav|Tomorrow is a new day.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_179.wav|It makes no influence on the public.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_180.wav|She has left the island.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_181.wav|He played it like a veteran.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_182.wav|I have spoken to head office.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_183.wav|They will run a mile.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_184.wav|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_185.wav|Our destiny is in our own hands.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_186.wav|He prefers to play for them.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_188.wav|He lives in a neighbouring village.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_189.wav|It was an odd affair, in many respects.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_190.wav|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_191.wav|We represent a wide range of society.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_192.wav|We always felt we could win.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_194.wav|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_195.wav|It is not all good news and relief for Labour, however.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_196.wav|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_198.wav|I made a terrible start.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_199.wav|The result is called a patent.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_200.wav|We played them off the pitch.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_201.wav|Racism has no place in any sport.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_202.wav|Tommy is not a problem.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_203.wav|The sanctions are about collective punishment.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_204.wav|This is a holy place.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_205.wav|He had suffered a heart attack.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_206.wav|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_207.wav|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_208.wav|This will take several weeks.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_209.wav|The research is published in the journal, Nature.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_210.wav|We have an election in eight days.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_211.wav|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_212.wav|There is no quick fix.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_213.wav|All will be revealed in due course.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_214.wav|We used to live with dignity in our country.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_215.wav|The most exciting room is the final one of the show.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_216.wav|He has made his base in Spain.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_217.wav|My life is in the ballet.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_218.wav|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_219.wav|It's all change at Kilmarnock.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_220.wav|His second was a beauty.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_221.wav|What do we want to do that for ?|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_222.wav|Does the name matter ?|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_223.wav|How do you get it back ?|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_224.wav|What are you not good at ?|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_225.wav|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_226.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_227.wav|It was a day for records.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_228.wav|He remains a main board director of Royal.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_230.wav|That has been the easy part.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_231.wav|Things were so intense in the studio.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_232.wav|I was not sure whether I had won.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_233.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_234.wav|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_235.wav|It is the voice of the survivors.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_236.wav|It had so much to do with output.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_237.wav|Must have been at the bar.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_238.wav|She died in middle age.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_239.wav|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_240.wav|They need to win a trophy.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_241.wav|Half the young people had had contact with the police.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_242.wav|It is possible to be too good.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_243.wav|In many ways, that is as important.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_244.wav|Here is a question for you.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_245.wav|I was just a kid.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_246.wav|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_247.wav|Hospitals are for the ill.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_248.wav|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.|5,,
wav48/p230/p230_249.wav|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_250.wav|We have to compete at our own level.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_251.wav|They showed a lot of heart.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_252.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_253.wav|It might be sad, but it's a fact.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_254.wav|She took them for a term.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_255.wav|Kingfisher can afford to wait.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_257.wav|Nato was not a love affair.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_258.wav|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_259.wav|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_260.wav|In fact, we were all over the shop.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_261.wav|You can feel at home in China.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_262.wav|Persuaded to change his mind.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_263.wav|Either way, the investor retains the premium.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_264.wav|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_265.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_266.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.|5,,
wav48/p230/p230_267.wav|I should think so, too.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_268.wav|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_269.wav|I've had no discussions with the chairman of the board.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_270.wav|I was ready for this.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_271.wav|On the contrary they stand to gain.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_272.wav|They are interior designers and architects.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_273.wav|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_274.wav|We feel very good about it.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_276.wav|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_277.wav|It is also very valuable.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_278.wav|None of this work is guaranteed.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_279.wav|There is a case to answer.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_280.wav|We're trying to get rounded performers.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_281.wav|They can leave at any time.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_282.wav|And they were being paid ?|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_283.wav|was everything done to save people ?|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_284.wav|What was the matter for concern ?|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_285.wav|Do I think about them often ?|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_286.wav|That was a gold medal for certain.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_287.wav|You get a lot for your money.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_288.wav|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_289.wav|In that moment, I was happy.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_290.wav|The actor has met with Mandela.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_291.wav|It was never a free kick.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_292.wav|It is a recipe for success.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_293.wav|I would rather look at him.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_295.wav|It's got to come from me.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_296.wav|It took a month and a half to film.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_297.wav|The cause of the accident remained unclear.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_298.wav|It is a symbolic concert.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_299.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_300.wav|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_302.wav|He is at war with his knee.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_303.wav|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_304.wav|I was there five months ago.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_305.wav|You have to see it like this.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_306.wav|Rugby is now just like football.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_307.wav|It could well be military.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_308.wav|His job was not advertised.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_309.wav|There is an element of racism in Scotland.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_310.wav|We have a clean bill of health.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_311.wav|And we can do it.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_312.wav|The songs are just so good.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_313.wav|The casting is as perfect.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_314.wav|I can hardly believe it.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_315.wav|I must do something about it.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_316.wav|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_317.wav|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_318.wav|They are not left wing.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_319.wav|McNaughton was not so sure.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_321.wav|It is a road of death.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_322.wav|The party lasted all night.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_323.wav|The group is not paying a dividend.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_324.wav|We were on our way.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_325.wav|I was as strong as a horse.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_326.wav|That meant the search was unlawful.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_327.wav|We have a good healthy debate.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_328.wav|I would do away with the dress code.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_329.wav|We are on a four-year mission.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_330.wav|This is a historic occasion.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_331.wav|This ruling is a farce.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_332.wav|I can see their argument.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_333.wav|After some discussion they did.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_334.wav|It was always an option.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_335.wav|Does that put pressure on us ?|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_336.wav|Did it work ?|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_337.wav|Do you think we are a top nation ?|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_338.wav|Public opinion was split on the proposal.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_339.wav|The election is total confusion and chaos.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_340.wav|You may have a short memory.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_341.wav|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_342.wav|In the old days, it was easy.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_343.wav|There was some merit in that.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_344.wav|That is a trend which will be encouraged.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_345.wav|The airport was even different.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_346.wav|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_347.wav|We think all other measures are not exhausted.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_348.wav|There was no time scale.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_349.wav|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_350.wav|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_351.wav|He is not very big, either.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_352.wav|I have a moral dilemma.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_353.wav|Even the one she loved.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_354.wav|You have no chance of planning permission.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_355.wav|We are encouraged by the news.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_356.wav|In addition, certain areas closed at certain times.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_357.wav|The professor said the results were positive.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_358.wav|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_359.wav|Three years ago he would have been.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_360.wav|Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_361.wav|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_362.wav|I am a lucky man.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_363.wav|Nobody else was with me.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_364.wav|We put our bid in last night.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_365.wav|Alex Ferguson is the same.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_366.wav|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_367.wav|But BA said the prediction was premature.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_368.wav|Like his acting, it was an accident.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_369.wav|They have broken the promise.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_370.wav|We are really good friends.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_371.wav|My goal is quite simple.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_372.wav|This is a major championship.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_373.wav|It's going to be fun.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_374.wav|She is now on the back benches.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_375.wav|Scrutiny by European Parliament is limited.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_376.wav|This hasn't happened in a vacuum.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_377.wav|Both of those promises have already been honoured.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_378.wav|We are a Scottish company.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_379.wav|We will win the argument.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_380.wav|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_381.wav|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_382.wav|I always knew she was funny.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_383.wav|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_384.wav|The marshall at the turn was great.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_385.wav|If you can get it.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_386.wav|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_387.wav|There was a substantial explosion.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_388.wav|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_389.wav|He could face a jail sentence.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_390.wav|That is the consistent approach of the Government.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_391.wav|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_392.wav|Clark is back on top form.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_393.wav|Motion described it as a unique event.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_394.wav|I had a fortunate war.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_395.wav|Are they free ?|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_396.wav|What are they for ?|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_397.wav|Is there a waiting list ?|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_398.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_399.wav|That investment has now been secured.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_400.wav|It is a large number.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_401.wav|You will not feel a thing.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_402.wav|I've never seen a game like it.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_404.wav|It does not even have a staff shortage.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_405.wav|It was a bank holiday, after all.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_406.wav|We're obviously disturbed by this case.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_407.wav|The casualties were not named.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_408.wav|It is a temptation which should be resisted.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_409.wav|It had been on the cards.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_410.wav|The second goal was superb.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_411.wav|Treatment is not an issue with these people.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_413.wav|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.|5,,,
wav48/p230/p230_414.wav|It is the old story.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_415.wav|This should put downward pressure on inflation.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_416.wav|No date has been set for a meeting.|5,,,,
wav48/p230/p230_417.wav|We have to build a new team in the minimum of time.|5,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_001.wav|Please call Stella. |6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |6,,
wav48/p231/p231_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |6,,
wav48/p231/p231_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |6,,
wav48/p231/p231_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky. |6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |6,,
wav48/p231/p231_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|6,,
wav48/p231/p231_025.wav|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_026.wav|I'd just like to play.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_027.wav|Because we do not need it.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_028.wav|There was a rush of water.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_029.wav|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_030.wav|That deal is a joke.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_031.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_032.wav|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_033.wav|It carried a double message.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_034.wav|That means an extra two years.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_035.wav|I became a widow overnight.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_036.wav|But he can turn on the charm.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_037.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_038.wav|The man became a reporter.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_039.wav|Mr Blair last night attended his weekly audience with the Queen.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_040.wav|Last year, I was pretty bad.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_041.wav|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_042.wav|Among them are many criminals.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_043.wav|He looks like an Afghan.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_044.wav|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_045.wav|I guess I was lucky, though.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_046.wav|I was inspired by two things.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_047.wav|A win is a win.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_048.wav|There was no safety net.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_049.wav|There's nothing we could do about this.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_050.wav|It is a symbolic concert.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_051.wav|We keep an eye on it.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_052.wav|We have not given up hope.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_053.wav|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_054.wav|She said she was really sorry.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_055.wav|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_056.wav|Italy is a beautiful place.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_057.wav|Four other charges were dropped.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_058.wav|We should be able to cope.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_059.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_061.wav|So is that it, then ?|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_062.wav|Do I have a favourite ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_063.wav|What do we do ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_064.wav|It was a lovely experience.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_065.wav|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_066.wav|We will pay their bills.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_067.wav|Only water is currently allowed.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_068.wav|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_069.wav|We need to increase the membership.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_070.wav|This is an exciting new venture.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_071.wav|He highlighted a lack of staff.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_072.wav|Then followed a bout of flu.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_073.wav|Both sides have been hit by injury.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_074.wav|Both men were on one-year contracts.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_076.wav|That would be too easy.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_078.wav|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_079.wav|Both agreed on the success of the event.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_080.wav|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.|6,,
wav48/p231/p231_081.wav|On Saturday, it was much the same.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_082.wav|It's so hard to shift.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_083.wav|They lived for their children.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_085.wav|However, it did not end that way.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_086.wav|Strathclyde Police declined to comment.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_087.wav|It is an old family habit.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_088.wav|He's been hit by it.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_089.wav|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_090.wav|I saw the whole thing.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_091.wav|But I know the course.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_092.wav|Their attitude is all wrong.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_093.wav|We must stop it with the golf ball.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_094.wav|You are like an animal.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_095.wav|This is the logic of punishment assaults.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_097.wav|We should recognise others have done a good job.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_098.wav|We live by the rule of law.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_099.wav|Two of the team became ill.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_100.wav|No, the equipment is extra.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_101.wav|That time is not now, however.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_102.wav|It's not a quick fix.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_103.wav|Why do it otherwise ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_104.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_105.wav|So, did she meet him ?|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_106.wav|So what is the campaign about ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_107.wav|And does it ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_108.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_109.wav|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_110.wav|You'd better believe it.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_111.wav|New Year will be very busy.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_112.wav|There's still plenty time left.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_113.wav|It proved a good decision.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_114.wav|Maybe this battle has been.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_115.wav|January is a bad time of year.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_116.wav|I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_117.wav|It is much as it has been described.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_118.wav|Then again, we could have.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_119.wav|It is a delight on every level.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_120.wav|There were no grounds for his action.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_121.wav|I was just a child.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_122.wav|We should not be surprised.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_123.wav|It was not a finale he would want to remember.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_124.wav|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_125.wav|That period was a struggle.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_126.wav|It is too pretty, it is too small.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_127.wav|This should begin in October.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_128.wav|That is far too high.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_129.wav|If not, a deal could take many months.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_130.wav|It plans to return to this field.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_131.wav|They made such decisions in London.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_132.wav|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_133.wav|It is a common problem.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_134.wav|You're a gambling man.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_135.wav|We must recognise that this outfit is unique.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_136.wav|He is a great addition to our team.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_137.wav|This is a successful outcome.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_138.wav|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_139.wav|Put yourself in the position of being a referee.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_140.wav|I think he's the favourite, no question.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_141.wav|I miss the freedom that I had.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_142.wav|It only increased the support for him.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_143.wav|Anyone can do the sums.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_144.wav|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_145.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_146.wav|It has become a way of life.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_147.wav|The whole industry is a shambles.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_148.wav|There's only one team in Ayrshire.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_149.wav|It was deployed in the Gulf War.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_150.wav|We have a clean bill of health.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_151.wav|It is not normal practice.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_152.wav|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_153.wav|He was asked to quit.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_154.wav|A new school will be built.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_155.wav|The strong pound also took its toll.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_156.wav|It is a terrible tragedy.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_157.wav|He was right into football from an early age.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_158.wav|It is not like us.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_159.wav|What happened in that game ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_160.wav|Are you going to win ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_161.wav|Was it the wife ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_162.wav|Why change it ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_163.wav|What do we want to do that for ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_164.wav|He was in great spirits.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_165.wav|We have a budget in March.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_166.wav|You've been a great audience.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_167.wav|It is simply not true.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_168.wav|Well, this article is a bit like that.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_169.wav|It is really good news.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_170.wav|We've made a couple of albums.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_171.wav|To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_172.wav|My life has been destroyed.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_173.wav|I always felt they played for me.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_174.wav|One season, they might do well.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_175.wav|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_176.wav|This much I can tell you.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_177.wav|The Hibs manager is no fool.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_178.wav|We are the gateway to justice.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_179.wav|But one was not enough.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_180.wav|I have spoken to head office.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_181.wav|I am not ready to walk away.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_183.wav|The shooting created panic in the street.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_184.wav|So many people will be affected by this.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_185.wav|As many as the market will support.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_186.wav|They need to look after themselves.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_188.wav|This is the time to use it.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_189.wav|You know the sort of thing.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_190.wav|I'm interested in interesting work.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_191.wav|We represent a wide range of society.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_192.wav|People will ask about us.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_193.wav|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_194.wav|This should put downward pressure on inflation.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_195.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_196.wav|I came home by ambulance.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_197.wav|I suggest a new plan.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_198.wav|It was a moment of madness.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_199.wav|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_200.wav|Libya is an easy target.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_201.wav|Does the name matter ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_202.wav|how do you get it back ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_203.wav|What are you no good at ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_205.wav|Who was she ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_206.wav|It gave no further details.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_207.wav|You've caught a serial killer.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_208.wav|I won't make an official complaint.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_209.wav|We are a new department.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_210.wav|It was worth a photograph.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_211.wav|They are looking at flotation.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_212.wav|Which isn't a bad idea.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_213.wav|We have an election in eight days.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_214.wav|He also presented You Bet!|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_215.wav|That might help a bit.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_216.wav|I had decided to quit the show.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_217.wav|He has a lot of skill.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_218.wav|I've wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_219.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_220.wav|And the World Cup has not even begun.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_221.wav|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_222.wav|That you can do it.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_223.wav|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_224.wav|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_225.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.|6,,
wav48/p231/p231_226.wav|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_228.wav|We played them off the pitch.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_229.wav|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_230.wav|They are the innocent victims.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_231.wav|Paterson can afford to be generous.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_232.wav|She died in middle age.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_233.wav|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_234.wav|It is set in Paris.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_235.wav|The irony was not lost.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_236.wav|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_237.wav|Hospitals are for the ill.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_238.wav|The minister is the engineer.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_239.wav|My future is in the marathon.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_240.wav|It is now the big brother.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_241.wav|The parties have no contact.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_242.wav|She took them for a term.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_243.wav|Nato was not a love affair.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_244.wav|He is due in Israel tomorrow.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_245.wav|You can feel at home in China.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_246.wav|His is a global perspective.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_247.wav|Persuaded to change his mind.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_248.wav|Either way, the investor retains the premium.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_249.wav|This ruling is a farce.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_250.wav|The baby deserves the credit.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_251.wav|Washington is consumed by the crisis.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_252.wav|But they were never expected to last.|6,,,,

wav48/p231/p231_255.wav|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_256.wav|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_257.wav|He admitted that he knew nothing about it.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_258.wav|It seems a shame to leave it.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_259.wav|It was the climax of the thing.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_260.wav|The concerns are the same.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_261.wav|I can't get a job.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_262.wav|And they were being paid ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_263.wav|was everything done to save people ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_264.wav|What was the matter for concern ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_265.wav|Do I think about them often ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_266.wav|Is it in the right place ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_267.wav|Did he trip ?|6,,,,

wav48/p231/p231_269.wav|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_270.wav|On the contrary they stand to gain.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_271.wav|I thought he might have been a bit.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_272.wav|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_273.wav|I'd never run for them.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_274.wav|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_275.wav|It does not work that way in Scottish football.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_276.wav|These figures are truly terrible.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_277.wav|Share prices have fallen for three years in a row.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_278.wav|The joint bid is still on course.|6,,,,

wav48/p231/p231_283.wav|You get a lot for your money.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_284.wav|Blair also had a penalty.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_285.wav|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_286.wav|Frankly, we should all have such problems.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_288.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_289.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_290.wav|They were on holiday in Egypt.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_291.wav|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_292.wav|I've lost all confidence.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_293.wav|This could be a mistake.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_294.wav|Once again, they would be wrong.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_295.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_296.wav|It's all designed to speed up the service.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_297.wav|He will address the nation this evening.|6,,,,

wav48/p231/p231_299.wav|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_300.wav|But it is up again.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_301.wav|Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_302.wav|It could well be military.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_303.wav|I was just so determined.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_304.wav|That was the difference between the sides.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_305.wav|The judge was really nice.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_307.wav|You are a different people.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_308.wav|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_309.wav|He is still in shock.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_310.wav|McNaughton was not so sure.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_312.wav|I thought it was my only chance.|6,,,,

wav48/p231/p231_315.wav|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_316.wav|We're on our way.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_317.wav|They come to enjoy themselves.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_318.wav|That meant the search was unlawful.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_319.wav|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_320.wav|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.|6,,
wav48/p231/p231_322.wav|We want to play at the worlds.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_323.wav|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_324.wav|We have got no money to go anywhere.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_325.wav|Have a look at this lot.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_326.wav|That decision will be made over the next couple of days.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_327.wav|The king is delighted by the honour.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_328.wav|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_329.wav|The problems began a long time ago.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_330.wav|I am not sure about the rate of progress.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_331.wav|To beat the European champion is quite nice.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_332.wav|In the old days, it was easy.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_333.wav|However, the groups denied the claims.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_334.wav|She is now on the back benches.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_336.wav|I think it's about time.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_337.wav|The airport was even different.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_338.wav|There was no time scale.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_339.wav|In his absence, the council adopted the change.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_340.wav|At first, the youngster was not keen.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_341.wav|The figures are bad, but not that bad.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_342.wav|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_343.wav|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_344.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_345.wav|Finally came the moment of truth.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_346.wav|We are encouraged by the news.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_347.wav|What form did that take ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_348.wav|Are they free ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_349.wav|What are they for ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_350.wav|Is there a waiting list ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_351.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_352.wav|So what happens next ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_353.wav|The units will not be replaced.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_354.wav|Neither man has been charged.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_355.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_357.wav|Look at the Liberal Democrats.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_358.wav|I am a lucky man.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_359.wav|But they have taken the lesson to heart.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_360.wav|I've always been a sensitive.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_361.wav|Glasgow is a friendly city.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_362.wav|You did not see it.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_363.wav|We live on an island.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_364.wav|It is not real life.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_365.wav|Neither woman has been named.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_366.wav|They should take their mobile phones.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_367.wav|You need a licence to run a pub.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_368.wav|We regret that they're brought in the first place.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_369.wav|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_370.wav|This is a major championship.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_371.wav|The result is called a patent.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_372.wav|But we finished the show.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_373.wav|They were to blame for the first two goals.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_374.wav|There is no deal as yet.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_375.wav|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_376.wav|We were given a break.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_377.wav|In due course the deal was done.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_378.wav|to have products for their needs.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_379.wav|The pair are very much in love.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_380.wav|We will win the argument.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_381.wav|Had this been common practice ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_382.wav|What do they want us to do ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_383.wav|Is it worth it ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_384.wav|Does it matter ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_385.wav|You have to rely on each other.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_386.wav|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_387.wav|I wanted to go out on a high.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_388.wav|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_389.wav|That time may never be broken.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_390.wav|It was fit for royalty.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_391.wav|The response from them was good.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_392.wav|There was a substantial explosion.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_393.wav|But we are very near.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_394.wav|That's as good as it gets.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_395.wav|A review is under way.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_396.wav|He put some colour into Scottish history.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_397.wav|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_398.wav|They have failed to deliver.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_399.wav|Clark is back on top form.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_400.wav|I had a fortunate war.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_401.wav|She is in their hands.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_402.wav|It is a large number.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_403.wav|It does not even have a staff shortage.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_404.wav|It is hard to understand.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_405.wav|It was a bank holiday, after all.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_406.wav|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_407.wav|There was an element of frustration.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_408.wav|I should think so, too.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_409.wav|How do you take them away ?|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_411.wav|After the match, do you ?|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_412.wav|I will always remember the horrible images.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_414.wav|They are looking for profit.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_415.wav|I remain a buyer of the shares.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_416.wav|There is some light in the tunnel.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_417.wav|He liked the weather, the courses, the food.|6,,
wav48/p231/p231_418.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_419.wav|The case will now go to appeal.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_420.wav|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_421.wav|There is a solution, she believes.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_422.wav|Yet the data is compelling.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_423.wav|It was important to win the singles.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_424.wav|The road was closed for several hours.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_426.wav|My aim is a top six finish.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_427.wav|I would love to think that she could win.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_428.wav|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_429.wav|He is on the wrong side.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_430.wav|It was a breathtaking moment.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_431.wav|I was in jail for five years.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_432.wav|I never had a childhood.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_433.wav|It is based on a true story.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_434.wav|But it can be done.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_435.wav|I never won a penny throughout my career.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_436.wav|There will be no excuses on Wednesday.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_437.wav|The growth potential is enormous.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_438.wav|They are not left wing.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_439.wav|The British government does not want to know.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_440.wav|They said they were only young men.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_441.wav|We shall not forget him.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_442.wav|The people are the hero.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_443.wav|They made a huge impression on me.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_444.wav|It's never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_445.wav|It sounded like a bomb.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_446.wav|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.|6,,
wav48/p231/p231_447.wav|We've got a good management record.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_448.wav|Sentiment was helped by the sharp fall in debt.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_449.wav|And we might go back.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_450.wav|We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_451.wav|We went straight into the bedroom.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_452.wav|Its future is no longer in question.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_453.wav|We put our bid in last night.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_454.wav|Today, he is in the same position as four years ago.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_456.wav|They have to be met.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_457.wav|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_458.wav|She has reached the top of her profession.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_459.wav|But he has a lifeline.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_460.wav|A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_461.wav|They were good years for him.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_462.wav|Let that be their memorial.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_463.wav|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_464.wav|Driving has been the key.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_465.wav|She has now been registered as disabled.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_466.wav|He is well respected by his colleagues.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_467.wav|Classes must be reduced by half.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_468.wav|War is not the action.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_469.wav|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.|6,,,
wav48/p231/p231_470.wav|It is too early to speculate.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_471.wav|Dennis was not so sure.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_472.wav|He felt it was the right time.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_473.wav|It was clear on Thursday.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_474.wav|The casting of her husband was an accident.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_475.wav|It was all in a short period of time.|6,,,,
wav48/p231/p231_476.wav|That was the first time I worked with Richard.|6,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_001.wav|Please call Stella. |7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |7,,
wav48/p232/p232_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |7,,
wav48/p232/p232_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |7,,
wav48/p232/p232_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |7,,
wav48/p232/p232_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|7,,
wav48/p232/p232_025.wav|Johnson was pretty low.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_026.wav|But it failed.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_027.wav|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_028.wav|They should be so lucky.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_029.wav|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|7,,
wav48/p232/p232_030.wav|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_031.wav|It's a matter of balance.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_032.wav|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_033.wav|I would love it.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_034.wav|It is marvellous.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_035.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_036.wav|But it may take some time to confirm the findings.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_037.wav|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.|7,,
wav48/p232/p232_038.wav|It was fit for royalty.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_039.wav|I was scared.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_040.wav|Dancing was her life.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_041.wav|I suspect the latter.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_042.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_043.wav|But it took a lot of bottle.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_044.wav|We will push.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_045.wav|It is urgent.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_046.wav|The judge said.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_047.wav|It is difficult for Ali.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_048.wav|But it might have done.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_049.wav|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_050.wav|They had to explain it.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_051.wav|Here's a clue.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_052.wav|We were surprised to see the photograph.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_053.wav|It's the big omission.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_054.wav|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_055.wav|It's very odd.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_056.wav|Because we do not need it.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_057.wav|It's not pretty, but it's effective.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_058.wav|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_059.wav|That's the truth.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_060.wav|That is very hard, alone.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_061.wav|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_062.wav|The problems are a result of that shortfall.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_063.wav|You do not change overnight.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_064.wav|People love to see this stuff.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_065.wav|He was popular.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_066.wav|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_067.wav|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_068.wav|It is like a river running by my home.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_069.wav|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_070.wav|There is an element of racism in Scotland.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_071.wav|Painful, but only because it's true.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_072.wav|That was the easy election.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_073.wav|There could be a way back.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_074.wav|Then followed a bout of flu.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_075.wav|The price cuts are really exciting.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_076.wav|I had my suspicions.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_077.wav|It was chaotic.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_078.wav|It is a job creation scheme.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_079.wav|He is now resident in England.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_080.wav|I've got the shirt.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_081.wav|Today she has been released.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_082.wav|What has changed ?|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_083.wav|That is bound to happen.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_084.wav|I will miss him.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_085.wav|It's all going to clear the debt.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_086.wav|She had kept the news from him.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_087.wav|No progress has been made.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_088.wav|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_089.wav|Now the system is right behind us.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_090.wav|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_091.wav|It is a lifeline.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_092.wav|Today I couldn't run on it.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_093.wav|However, it did not end that way.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_094.wav|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_095.wav|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_096.wav|Then came the crunch.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_097.wav|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_098.wav|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_099.wav|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_100.wav|It was mayhem.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_101.wav|They were outside the circle.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_102.wav|It was a good performance.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_103.wav|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_104.wav|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_105.wav|That is no use.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_106.wav|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_107.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_108.wav|He pleaded for caution.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_109.wav|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_110.wav|I don't have many friends.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_111.wav|He was jailed for a year.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_112.wav|You had better believe it.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_113.wav|It's not fair.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_114.wav|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_115.wav|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_116.wav|Maybe this battle has been.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_117.wav|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_118.wav|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_119.wav|This is the end of a chapter, and this is very sad.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_120.wav|It is rubbish.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_121.wav|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_122.wav|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_123.wav|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_124.wav|That's all right then.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_125.wav|I'm so angry.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_126.wav|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_127.wav|It has removed a bit of guilt.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_128.wav|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_129.wav|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_130.wav|Offered the gold medal, he declined.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_131.wav|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_132.wav|I am now unemployed.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_133.wav|If not, a deal could take many months.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_134.wav|You've got to be vigilant.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_135.wav|Our intentions are real.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_136.wav|They took a risk.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_137.wav|The goals were good.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_138.wav|What will happen then ?|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_139.wav|I am totally devoted to this job.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_140.wav|He is severe.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_141.wav|She died at her home.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_142.wav|I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_143.wav|They did very well.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_144.wav|The home side didn't stand a chance.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_145.wav|We want to see the maximum of change.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_146.wav|It was deployed in the Gulf War.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_147.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.|7,,
wav48/p232/p232_148.wav|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_149.wav|We also enjoyed a lot of support.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_150.wav|She had gone to the Catholic school.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_151.wav|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_152.wav|It was by the numbers.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_153.wav|I was in daily contact.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_154.wav|They were later discharged from hospital.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_155.wav|This latter point is hugely important.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_156.wav|It is an attitude of mind.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_158.wav|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_159.wav|We have to move forward.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_160.wav|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_161.wav|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_162.wav|Tell it like it was ?|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_163.wav|It is not too late to get on board.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_164.wav|That must be left to the Parole Board.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_165.wav|Again, we were lucky.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_166.wav|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_167.wav|Waiting times for these services are too long.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_168.wav|That will do for me.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_169.wav|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_170.wav|We've made a couple of albums.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_171.wav|My life has been destroyed.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_172.wav|They thought they had found a home.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_173.wav|It became a book by itself.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_174.wav|I always felt they played for me.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_175.wav|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_176.wav|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_177.wav|Blair's response was weak.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_178.wav|It's the real thing, for sure.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_179.wav|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_180.wav|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_181.wav|The clarity is vital.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_182.wav|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_183.wav|Everyone can be bought.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_184.wav|A career as a doctor is on hold.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_185.wav|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_186.wav|It is the whole package.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_187.wav|I've been there.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_188.wav|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_189.wav|They receive a high profile in the media.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_190.wav|We did everything by the book.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_191.wav|I wish I could say something.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_192.wav|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_193.wav|The procedure is the same in all cases.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_194.wav|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_195.wav|I wanted to put myself on the line.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_196.wav|I came home by ambulance.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_197.wav|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_198.wav|The conference is the first test.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_199.wav|The service from the other players was super.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_200.wav|He's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_201.wav|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_202.wav|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_203.wav|A deadline is still essential.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_204.wav|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_205.wav|It's a mixture of everything.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_206.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_207.wav|I don't want to use it.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_208.wav|Now, it's all right.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_209.wav|There was an e-mail.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_210.wav|That's the day job.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_211.wav|Feel the heat ?|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_212.wav|He knows a lot.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_213.wav|He is slightly confused.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_214.wav|She should not be blamed.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_215.wav|His third goal was superb.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_216.wav|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_217.wav|It's not ideal.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_218.wav|He seemed to lose his focus.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_219.wav|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_220.wav|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_221.wav|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_223.wav|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_224.wav|That has been the easy part.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_225.wav|We've got the bronze.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_226.wav|Mental health is a massive issue.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_227.wav|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_228.wav|It was good fun.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_229.wav|What was the main difference ?|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_230.wav|I am immensely sad.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_231.wav|I'd never seen a play about me.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_232.wav|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_233.wav|The track is currently covered in snow.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_234.wav|But she was.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_235.wav|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_236.wav|We were awful.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_237.wav|However, no further action was taken by police.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_238.wav|And thought we would get away with it.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_239.wav|It is set in Paris.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_240.wav|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_241.wav|It's quite nice.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_242.wav|It's quite a line-up!|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_243.wav|It's a lovely, lovely film.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_244.wav|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_245.wav|Broke the birdie record.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_246.wav|He claimed the government had lost the plot.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_247.wav|She is well balanced.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_248.wav|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_249.wav|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_250.wav|He says that he is no different from any other man.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_251.wav|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_252.wav|We did not compete with any other local farmer.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_253.wav|I was certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_254.wav|Some families have even requested to leave the city.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_255.wav|It's a record label, not a form of music.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_256.wav|A friendship that will endure.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_257.wav|I can't get a job.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_258.wav|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_259.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_260.wav|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_261.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_262.wav|It does not appear at this stage that alcohol was a factor.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_263.wav|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_264.wav|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_265.wav|Blood samples were taken.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_266.wav|They want to shut the Scottish Office.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_267.wav|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_268.wav|Of course, that is not the whole story.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_269.wav|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_270.wav|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_271.wav|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_272.wav|He is a young man with a new deal.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_273.wav|He was also married with two children.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_274.wav|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_275.wav|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_276.wav|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_277.wav|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_278.wav|They wanted the club to make money.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_279.wav|Finally, he paid for the movie.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_280.wav|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_281.wav|It's a way of life.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_282.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_283.wav|I am an estate agent.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_284.wav|The record companies have gone through the floor.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_285.wav|They were on holiday in Egypt.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_286.wav|It was a privilege to work for him.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_287.wav|It happens from time to time.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_288.wav|He looked very sharp.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_289.wav|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_290.wav|I saw it at a ruck.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_291.wav|They were also beside themselves.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_292.wav|The attacker died in the crash.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_293.wav|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_294.wav|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_295.wav|Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_296.wav|He was obviously very genuine.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_297.wav|These figures are truly awful.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_298.wav|He should have won.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_299.wav|He has retired.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_300.wav|What has altered ?|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_301.wav|I thought it was my only chance.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_302.wav|Nothing is safe.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_303.wav|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_305.wav|They are wrong.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_306.wav|It is a road of death.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_307.wav|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_308.wav|We are in the end game.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_309.wav|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_310.wav|He was solid.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_311.wav|Special measures were needed.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_312.wav|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_313.wav|I never thought it would take this long.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_314.wav|We are a peaceful people.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_315.wav|Kids are terrible.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_316.wav|It should be equal.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_317.wav|Craig is a major concern for us.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_318.wav|The home team had an amazing start.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_319.wav|For the moment, our position remains the same.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_320.wav|Referees are easy targets.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_321.wav|Davis is very supportive, as a director.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_322.wav|However, the groups denied the claims.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_323.wav|I came into this world with nothing.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_324.wav|We think all other measures are not exhausted.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_325.wav|Off with their heads.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_326.wav|It's not long enough.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_327.wav|My view has now completely changed.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_328.wav|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_329.wav|We agreed to disagree.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_330.wav|It could have gone either way.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_331.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_332.wav|Horses are drawn by ballot.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_333.wav|I'd like to take the plunge.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_334.wav|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_335.wav|She did not attend the courtroom.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_336.wav|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_337.wav|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_338.wav|The team for the first game could be this one.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_339.wav|They haven't got a hope.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_340.wav|Who will do it ?|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_341.wav|Gaelic provision continued to be good.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_342.wav|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_343.wav|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_344.wav|He has to learn.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_345.wav|Indeed, it was magical.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_346.wav|Tiger is the exception.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_347.wav|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_348.wav|That is the very reason why it was so vital.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_349.wav|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_350.wav|Chambers said he would accept the place.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_351.wav|Everything was an effort.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_352.wav|The boat was fantastic.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_353.wav|Like his acting, it was an accident.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_354.wav|It is long gone.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_355.wav|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_356.wav|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_357.wav|He had played well in that central role.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_358.wav|It's not that clear-cut.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_359.wav|She is free.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_360.wav|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_361.wav|I kept going for her.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_362.wav|You must have a government and a good civil service.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_363.wav|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_364.wav|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_365.wav|However, it was well worth the wait.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_366.wav|It benefits the whole family.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_367.wav|He has seen the past.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_368.wav|It was one in the afternoon.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_369.wav|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_370.wav|We will be homeless.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_371.wav|The scene is about this ?|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_372.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_373.wav|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_374.wav|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_375.wav|It was a double tragedy for the family.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_376.wav|He could make it.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_377.wav|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_378.wav|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_379.wav|They have not done so this season so far.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_380.wav|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_381.wav|Well, the big day has arrived.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_382.wav|Five members were disciplined.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_383.wav|Talks are progressing.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_384.wav|There is no signature.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_385.wav|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_386.wav|That left a bad taste in my mouth.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_387.wav|It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_388.wav|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_389.wav|It has moved on in the last week.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_390.wav|That's the name of the game, though.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_391.wav|You thought it was a headache.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_392.wav|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.|7,,
wav48/p232/p232_393.wav|A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_394.wav|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_395.wav|We're looking for justice.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_396.wav|I can lead by example.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_397.wav|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_398.wav|But they are still unlikely to be involved in combat.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_399.wav|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_400.wav|It will probably take me just days to spend it.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_401.wav|It is legally binding.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_402.wav|We knew nothing about it.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_403.wav|My house was shaking at the time.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_404.wav|This is a huge confidence boost.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_405.wav|We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_406.wav|He was a crazy man.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_407.wav|We should have known.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_408.wav|Feel the air, the space.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_409.wav|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_410.wav|I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_411.wav|You wanted the evidence.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_412.wav|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_413.wav|It was that bad, that low.|7,,,
wav48/p232/p232_414.wav|I was very young.|7,,,,
wav48/p232/p232_415.wav|We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.|7,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_001.wav|Please call Stella. |8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |8,,
wav48/p233/p233_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |8,,
wav48/p233/p233_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |8,,
wav48/p233/p233_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |8,,
wav48/p233/p233_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|8,,
wav48/p233/p233_025.wav|We are a service industry.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_026.wav|But we will have to wait.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_027.wav|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_028.wav|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_029.wav|However, the following year the cancer returned.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_030.wav|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_032.wav|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_033.wav|This is a central issue.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_037.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_038.wav|Victory was never in doubt.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_039.wav|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.|8,,
wav48/p233/p233_040.wav|We are the party of the future.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_041.wav|I have never been a member of the council.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_042.wav|He was in his element.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_043.wav|That means an extra two years.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_044.wav|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_045.wav|All businesses continue to trade.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_046.wav|The man became a reporter.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_047.wav|It depends on the decisions of the member states.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_048.wav|It is all starting to come together.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_049.wav|Part of the complex is historic.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_050.wav|The strategy is not without risk.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_051.wav|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.|8,,
wav48/p233/p233_052.wav|I was released after six days.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_053.wav|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_054.wav|We are working on it.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_055.wav|I've never been one for complaining about the press.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_056.wav|This trend is likely to strengthen.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_057.wav|Still, he did not let himself down this week.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_058.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.|8,,
wav48/p233/p233_059.wav|There was no safety net.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_060.wav|He looks as if he could be worth the risk.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_061.wav|You have to be patient.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_062.wav|That is all in the past.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_063.wav|That could be a mistake.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_064.wav|It was an amazing result.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_065.wav|Indeed, it is only the beginning.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_066.wav|He has not been dropped.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_067.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_068.wav|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.|8,,
wav48/p233/p233_070.wav|This time, it might be for real.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_071.wav|She did that for the rest of her life.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_072.wav|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_073.wav|It starts with the script.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_074.wav|We were under a bit of pressure.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_075.wav|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_076.wav|We can all make a mistake.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_077.wav|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_079.wav|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_080.wav|On the night, it was not enough.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_081.wav|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_082.wav|However, a ruling will not come before next week.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_083.wav|They were badly prepared for it.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_084.wav|It is not a story.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_085.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_086.wav|How are you, sir ?|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_087.wav|So is that it, then ?|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_088.wav|Do I have a favourite ?|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_089.wav|What do we do ?|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_090.wav|Why do it otherwise ?|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_091.wav|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_092.wav|They have a further report to make in March.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_093.wav|He is in the US.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_094.wav|The Festival is prepared to help.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_095.wav|By then, he was walking on water.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_096.wav|I had a bit in hand.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_097.wav|We have to have a full statement to Parliament.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_098.wav|I cannot wait to get started on it.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_099.wav|That is the fact of the matter.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_100.wav|It should be a condition of employment.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_101.wav|I had no intention of misleading anyone.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_102.wav|It is much as it has been described.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_103.wav|Police said the family was helping with the search.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_104.wav|She was there for the start of the campaign.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_105.wav|He has become a monster.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_106.wav|In fact, he should never have been in the field.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_107.wav|Everyone had to play the game.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_108.wav|In London today, it was business as usual.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_109.wav|It is not affected by the sale.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_110.wav|We are currently working on the details.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_111.wav|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_112.wav|I thought it was a fantastic game.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_113.wav|The picture is the same across Scotland.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_114.wav|It was the eighties.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_115.wav|We do not expect any surplus.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_116.wav|You had better believe it.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_117.wav|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_118.wav|It's not a new concept in jazz.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_119.wav|My office is bare.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_120.wav|I'm delighted about that.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_121.wav|I joined a group.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_122.wav|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_123.wav|Who would be a referee?|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_125.wav|That's all right then.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_126.wav|There were no grounds for his action.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_127.wav|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_128.wav|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_129.wav|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_130.wav|Next season for every manager is a long time away.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_131.wav|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_132.wav|He's been the key to everything.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_133.wav|It's an amazing landscape!|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_134.wav|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_135.wav|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_136.wav|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_137.wav|I am now unemployed.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_138.wav|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_139.wav|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_140.wav|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_141.wav|Mr Hall is believed to have broken a leg.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_142.wav|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_143.wav|Is that it ?|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_144.wav|I saw some terrible things.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_146.wav|It seems so long since I did the exams.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_147.wav|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_148.wav|Who would be right ?|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_149.wav|She died at her home.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_150.wav|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_151.wav|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_152.wav|It is like a football team.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_153.wav|It would be a last resort.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_154.wav|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_155.wav|He will emerge as a world leader.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_156.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_157.wav|The home side didn't stand a chance.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_158.wav|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_159.wav|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_160.wav|I was so nervous.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_161.wav|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_162.wav|It was deployed in the Gulf War.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_163.wav|It is not normal practice.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_164.wav|We also enjoyed a lot of support.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_165.wav|The attacker has been put in foster care.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_166.wav|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_167.wav|Neither side can win this war.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_168.wav|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_169.wav|It is so unfair.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_170.wav|I will tell you.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_171.wav|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_172.wav|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_173.wav|I have got a wife to feed.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_174.wav|It's that sort of night.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_175.wav|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_176.wav|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_177.wav|The release attracted little attention.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_178.wav|Waiting times for these services are too long.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_179.wav|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_180.wav|We've made a couple of albums.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_181.wav|They thought they had found a home.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_182.wav|He will feel the pain again.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_183.wav|I always felt they played for me.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_184.wav|Is Saddam a threat ?|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_185.wav|I feel like my game has come a long way.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_186.wav|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_187.wav|If that's the case, he will struggle.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_188.wav|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_189.wav|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_190.wav|I was totally wrong.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_191.wav|There is no point in looking any further.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_192.wav|I've been there.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_193.wav|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_194.wav|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_195.wav|It's a joke.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_196.wav|I had a train to catch.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_197.wav|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_198.wav|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_199.wav|However, this idea is never developed.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_200.wav|It's very difficult to find a buyer.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_201.wav|He may need it.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_203.wav|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.|8,,
wav48/p233/p233_204.wav|It wasn't to be.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_208.wav|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_209.wav|I have a cold.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_210.wav|He had suffered a heart attack.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_211.wav|A deadline is still essential.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_212.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.|8,,
wav48/p233/p233_213.wav|It was worth a photograph.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_214.wav|That will be vital.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_215.wav|We need to handle it.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_216.wav|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_217.wav|I had relied on him.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_218.wav|His third goal was superb.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_220.wav|In each case they were a goal down.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_221.wav|The FBI could become involved.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_222.wav|Work has started.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_223.wav|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_224.wav|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_225.wav|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_226.wav|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_228.wav|Mental health is a massive issue.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_229.wav|You have to do your research.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_230.wav|We played them off the pitch.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_231.wav|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_232.wav|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_233.wav|It's a question of creating a future awareness.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_234.wav|My neighbours are horrified.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_235.wav|But he failed to win the committee's support.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_236.wav|I can't wait to meet him.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_237.wav|Broke the birdie record.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_238.wav|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_239.wav|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_240.wav|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_241.wav|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_242.wav|We were extremely poor.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_243.wav|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_244.wav|Chambers said he would accept the place.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_245.wav|I know I'm in a very special position.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_246.wav|We did not compete with any other local farmer.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_247.wav|The salary changes are long overdue.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_248.wav|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_249.wav|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_250.wav|There wasn't a goal.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_251.wav|It was a cry for help.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_252.wav|A friendship that will endure.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_253.wav|This year I understood.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_254.wav|Her presence was almost everywhere.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_255.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_256.wav|The distinction is also supported by doctors.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_257.wav|I watched a game.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_258.wav|There will be tough opponents to this report.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_259.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_260.wav|I was happily surprised.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_261.wav|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_262.wav|It is also very valuable.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_263.wav|I've spent a lot of time on buses.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_264.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_265.wav|It is not just about pay.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_266.wav|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_267.wav|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.|8,,
wav48/p233/p233_268.wav|Blood samples were taken.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_269.wav|They are never here.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_270.wav|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_271.wav|It looks as though he will be right.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_272.wav|We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_273.wav|Immediate action must be taken.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_274.wav|He is a young man with a new deal.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_275.wav|It was an easy decision to come here.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_276.wav|It is the same in Sweden.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_277.wav|And Michael was just great.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_278.wav|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_279.wav|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_280.wav|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_281.wav|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.|8,,
wav48/p233/p233_282.wav|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_283.wav|I feel pretty good.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_284.wav|They were on holiday in Egypt.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_285.wav|It was a privilege to work for him.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_286.wav|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_288.wav|They were too hard.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_289.wav|He looked very sharp.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_290.wav|All options are open.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_291.wav|The attacker died in the crash.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_292.wav|It was a virus.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_294.wav|I do not think this family will ever get over this.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_295.wav|Like his acting, it was an accident.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_296.wav|Sunday's game was not a trial.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_297.wav|Who can predict ?|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_298.wav|This is a huge confidence boost.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_299.wav|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_300.wav|We have to sort it out ourselves.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_301.wav|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_302.wav|I thought it was my only chance.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_303.wav|One was a lawyer.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_304.wav|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_305.wav|They should be swept away.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_306.wav|This is a war over our home.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_307.wav|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_308.wav|I was in daily contact.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_309.wav|We want to play at the worlds.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_310.wav|This is the culture change in medicine.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_311.wav|Is there on his hands ?|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_312.wav|We have got no money to go anywhere.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_313.wav|The election is total confusion and chaos.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_314.wav|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_315.wav|The problems began a long time ago.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_316.wav|My body is clearly capable.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_317.wav|We are very strongly behind the bid.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_319.wav|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_320.wav|My view has now completely changed.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_321.wav|It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_322.wav|We agreed to disagree.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_323.wav|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_324.wav|I saw some good things.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_325.wav|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_326.wav|Robert is a special talent.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_327.wav|It added to the spectacle.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_328.wav|Who was the mystery MP ?|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_329.wav|He told the court.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_330.wav|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_331.wav|Who will do it ?|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_332.wav|However, Sharon rejected the claims.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_333.wav|Gaelic provision continued to be good.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_334.wav|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_335.wav|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_336.wav|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_337.wav|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_338.wav|Nobody else was with me.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_339.wav|I've learned from my mistakes.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_340.wav|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_341.wav|The composer will conduct.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_342.wav|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_343.wav|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_344.wav|His contract was then not renewed.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_345.wav|Eight months later, he was dead.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_346.wav|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_347.wav|He had played well in that central role.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_348.wav|The decision is an absolute disgrace.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_349.wav|Tyson is overwhelmed.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_350.wav|However, it was well worth the wait.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_351.wav|He agreed with my proposal.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_352.wav|Hartley should know.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_353.wav|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_354.wav|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_355.wav|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_356.wav|Also, it is the season of goodwill.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_357.wav|Equity declined to comment.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_358.wav|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_359.wav|He could make it.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_360.wav|The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_361.wav|They have not done so this season so far.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_362.wav|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_363.wav|Safety was also an issue.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_364.wav|They received a reply from their own managers.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_365.wav|But I managed.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_366.wav|They play together perfectly.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_367.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_368.wav|Colour was at the core of his life.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_369.wav|It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_370.wav|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_371.wav|We shall not be moved.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_373.wav|It was a hit.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_374.wav|He's a nice guy.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_375.wav|Treatment is not an issue with these people.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_376.wav|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_377.wav|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_378.wav|The mood was defiant.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_379.wav|Yet the data is compelling.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_381.wav|It's just outrageous.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_382.wav|The road was closed for several hours.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_383.wav|It is unusual.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_384.wav|That will come after the game on Saturday.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_385.wav|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_386.wav|That set the tone.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_387.wav|It was a breathtaking moment.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_388.wav|I was in jail for five years.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_389.wav|What happened in the summer ?|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_390.wav|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.|8,,,,
wav48/p233/p233_391.wav|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.|8,,,
wav48/p233/p233_392.wav|He has not created a Festival resource.|8,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_001.wav|Please call Stella. |9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |9,,
wav48/p234/p234_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |9,,
wav48/p234/p234_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |9,,
wav48/p234/p234_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |9,,
wav48/p234/p234_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|9,,
wav48/p234/p234_025.wav|We are a service industry.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_026.wav|But we will have to wait.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_027.wav|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_028.wav|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_029.wav|However, the following year the cancer returned.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_030.wav|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_031.wav|It is on the internet.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_032.wav|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_033.wav|This is a central issue.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_034.wav|It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_035.wav|History is in the making.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_036.wav|It was sold at a loss.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_037.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_038.wav|Victory was never in doubt.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_039.wav|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.|9,,
wav48/p234/p234_040.wav|We are the party of the future.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_041.wav|I have never been a member of the council.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_042.wav|He was in his element.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_043.wav|That means an extra two years.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_044.wav|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_045.wav|All businesses continue to trade.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_046.wav|The man became a reporter.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_047.wav|It depends on the decisions of the member states.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_048.wav|It is all starting to come together.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_049.wav|Part of the complex is historic.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_050.wav|The strategy is not without risk.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_051.wav|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.|9,,
wav48/p234/p234_052.wav|I was released after six days.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_053.wav|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_054.wav|We are working on it.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_055.wav|I've never been one for complaining about the press.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_056.wav|This trend is likely to strengthen.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_057.wav|Still, he did not let himself down this week.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_058.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.|9,,
wav48/p234/p234_059.wav|There was no safety net.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_060.wav|He looks as if he could be worth the risk.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_061.wav|You have to be patient.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_062.wav|That is all in the past.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_063.wav|That could be a mistake.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_064.wav|It was an amazing result.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_065.wav|Indeed, it is only the beginning.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_066.wav|He has not been dropped.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_067.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_068.wav|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.|9,,
wav48/p234/p234_069.wav|The market is appalling for initial public offerings.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_070.wav|This time, it might be for real.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_071.wav|She did that for the rest of her life.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_072.wav|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_073.wav|It starts with the script.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_074.wav|We were under a bit of pressure.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_075.wav|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_076.wav|We can all make a mistake.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_077.wav|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_079.wav|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_080.wav|On the night, it was not enough.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_081.wav|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_082.wav|However, a ruling will not come before next week.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_083.wav|They were badly prepared for it.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_084.wav|It is not a story.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_085.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_086.wav|How are you, sir ?|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_087.wav|So is that it, then ?|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_088.wav|Do I have a favourite ?|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_089.wav|What do we do ?|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_090.wav|Why do it otherwise ?|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_091.wav|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_092.wav|They have a further report to make in March.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_093.wav|He is in the US.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_094.wav|The Festival is prepared to help.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_095.wav|By then, he was walking on water.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_096.wav|I had a bit in hand.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_097.wav|We have to have a full statement to Parliament.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_098.wav|I cannot wait to get started on it.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_099.wav|That is the fact of the matter.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_100.wav|It should be a condition of employment.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_101.wav|I had no intention of misleading anyone.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_102.wav|It is much as it has been described.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_103.wav|Police said the family was helping with the search.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_104.wav|She was there for the start of the campaign.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_105.wav|He has become a monster.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_106.wav|In fact, he should never have been in the field.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_107.wav|Everyone had to play the game.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_108.wav|In London today, it was business as usual.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_109.wav|It is not affected by the sale.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_110.wav|We are currently working on the details.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_111.wav|That would be decided at the interim results in November, he added.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_112.wav|That would be a serious problem.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_113.wav|Our action is not the end, but the beginning of a process.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_114.wav|People have been placed in a state of alarm.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_115.wav|She is not a victim.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_116.wav|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_117.wav|And we had a good response.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_118.wav|When we looked at the company.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_119.wav|No, the equipment is extra.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_120.wav|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_121.wav|The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_122.wav|That admission is not surprising.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_123.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_124.wav|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_125.wav|There was a lot of resentment.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_126.wav|He wanted to record the group.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_127.wav|However, it was a different story in the final.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_128.wav|The end result is the same.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_129.wav|Three days later, he was killed.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_130.wav|We are committed to the ban.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_131.wav|However, the bank denied that he was in the running.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_132.wav|The problem was a social problem.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_133.wav|He had no money left to run the club.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_134.wav|It is not so simple.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_135.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_136.wav|So, did she meet him ?|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_137.wav|So what is the campaign about ?|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_138.wav|And does it ?|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_139.wav|Are you from the rugby ?|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_140.wav|Actors like to be in the centre.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_141.wav|When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_142.wav|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_143.wav|Here, again, they were denied a voice.|9,,
wav48/p234/p234_144.wav|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_145.wav|I can't even get into the A team.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_146.wav|In addition, investor choice is reduced.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_147.wav|She does not want to speak.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_148.wav|It is expected to last a week.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_149.wav|Full consent is expected by the end of next year.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_150.wav|It is too pretty, it is too small.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_151.wav|As for the warning, it was not needed.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_152.wav|But it is different in different regions.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_153.wav|That is the nature of the game.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_154.wav|There is a spring in the step.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_155.wav|We want to get there.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_156.wav|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_157.wav|I have a lot of confidence in this team.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_158.wav|The players were under pressure.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_159.wav|Not that the occasion was without restraint.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_160.wav|There is no common ground.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_161.wav|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_162.wav|In that case, the children were not missing.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_163.wav|Frankly, it was worth the booking.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_164.wav|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.|9,,
wav48/p234/p234_165.wav|Anyone can do the sums.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_166.wav|At the moment we do not understand it.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_167.wav|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_168.wav|It is not about the money, it is about everything.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_169.wav|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_170.wav|Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_171.wav|Much of the equipment was new.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_172.wav|I have had a good life.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_173.wav|Three hours later, the man was free.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_174.wav|That was the difference between the sides.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_175.wav|They have not been named.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_176.wav|I was in a hole.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_177.wav|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_178.wav|I was always in control.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_179.wav|I would like to see the figures for the second quarter.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_180.wav|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_181.wav|He was asked to quit.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_182.wav|There remains an outstanding damages action against the former.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_183.wav|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_184.wav|They were not seeking the right to strike.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_185.wav|He called for a public inquiry.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_186.wav|Tony Blair has had a good conference.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_187.wav|As, indeed, they would be.|9,,
wav48/p234/p234_188.wav|By then, however, both men were already in the US.|9,,
wav48/p234/p234_189.wav|It is simply not true.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_190.wav|In light of things, I think I made the right decision.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_191.wav|It is not in the public interest.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_192.wav|Well, this article is a bit like that.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_193.wav|The performance is not there.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_194.wav|It would make a lot of sense.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_195.wav|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_196.wav|Clearly, they had other problems.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_197.wav|He has defended the system.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_198.wav|If that's the case, he will struggle.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_199.wav|I could not sit in the stands.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_200.wav|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_201.wav|They have to get that sorted.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_202.wav|Yet the performance was not entirely convincing.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_203.wav|We can take the city.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_204.wav|Are you going to win ?|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_205.wav|Was it the wife ?|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_207.wav|What do we want to do that for ?|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_208.wav|Does the name matter ?|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_209.wav|I will be in Scotland.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_210.wav|It was the story of the second half.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_211.wav|The trading conditions are not good.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_212.wav|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_213.wav|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_214.wav|This is an interesting link.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_216.wav|It was a management problem in the hospital.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_217.wav|Being investor ready is a good start.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_218.wav|Last night, the company could not be contacted.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_219.wav|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_220.wav|This conference was never confirmed.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_221.wav|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_222.wav|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_223.wav|He must have a crack at it.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_224.wav|The force is with them.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_225.wav|Her experience is certainly limited.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_226.wav|The deal is expected to be completed by September.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_227.wav|However, he said the money had not been wasted.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_228.wav|Mr Blair was ready for him.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_229.wav|We are waiting for the Minister to come back with an answer.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_230.wav|He intends to restart in the spring.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_231.wav|He is a good friend.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_232.wav|It is the strength of the school.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_233.wav|But it may not be all bad news.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_234.wav|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_235.wav|The conference is the first test.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_236.wav|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_237.wav|But we are not immune to the problem.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_238.wav|I was not overly concerned about this.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_239.wav|However, it is not as simple as this.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_240.wav|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_241.wav|A deadline is still essential.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_242.wav|And they were being paid ?|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_243.wav|Was everything done to save people ?|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_244.wav|What was the matter for concern ?|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_245.wav|Do I think about them often ?|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_246.wav|Is it in the right place ?|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_247.wav|Did he trip ?|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_248.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.|9,,
wav48/p234/p234_249.wav|You can buy them over the counter, anywhere.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_250.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_251.wav|We have an election in eight days.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_252.wav|It was far from business as usual.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_253.wav|It was just another play.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_254.wav|From there, they can go anywhere.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_255.wav|The world is a good place.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_256.wav|This is a sensible and common sense approach.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_257.wav|The matter is under appeal.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_258.wav|I am delighted for them.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_259.wav|It was a great experience.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_260.wav|They are difficult awards to decide.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_261.wav|Anyway, the job will be part-time.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_262.wav|His second was a beauty.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_263.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_264.wav|Scotland played a major part in the project.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_265.wav|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_266.wav|Not in this production he doesn't.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_267.wav|We can certainly build on this.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_268.wav|Then was the summer of their discontent.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_269.wav|There is a world of difference.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_270.wav|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_271.wav|Well, it was certainly different.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_272.wav|We want this place to work.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_273.wav|Clearly, the stakes are high.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_274.wav|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_275.wav|The statement contained no surprises.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_276.wav|The performance continues to improve.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_277.wav|That would be a danger.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_278.wav|Frankly, we were lucky to get second.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_279.wav|However, no further action was taken by police.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_280.wav|It depends on Labour, not on us.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_281.wav|I had to be into it.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_282.wav|My view has always been the same.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_283.wav|In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_284.wav|It is set in Paris.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_285.wav|Do you think we're a top nation ?|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_286.wav|Is our children learning ?|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_287.wav|How independent is that ?|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_288.wav|What form did that take ?|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_289.wav|Are they free ?|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_290.wav|The party has never fully recovered.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_291.wav|In many ways, that is as important.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_292.wav|His leader wanted to celebrate.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_293.wav|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_294.wav|Of further privacy, he had no need.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_295.wav|He was good, but not that good.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_296.wav|The results are expected within days.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_297.wav|The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_298.wav|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_299.wav|We were well worth the win.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_300.wav|And it was this one.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_301.wav|But that's another story for another day.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_302.wav|But it was also hard.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_303.wav|If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_304.wav|We're looking for unity in the council.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_305.wav|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_306.wav|They are not going the length of the pitch.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_307.wav|However, he lasted only five days before going on the run.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_308.wav|The concerns are the same.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_309.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_310.wav|Scotland won by six wickets.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_311.wav|It has to be enforced.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_312.wav|And we can do it.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_313.wav|Every one is a winner.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_314.wav|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_315.wav|They have set the standard.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_316.wav|This is a major property in Edinburgh.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_317.wav|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_318.wav|The existing structure is in trouble.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_319.wav|It all started with a visiting rugby club.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_320.wav|He refused to reveal the reasons for the split.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_321.wav|You have to count on other people.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_322.wav|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_323.wav|And he's the real thing.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_324.wav|What are they for ?|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_325.wav|Is there a waiting list ?|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_326.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_327.wav|But it is important for a number of reasons.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_328.wav|All of the management has invested in the firm.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_329.wav|The family is not interested in the value of the house.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_330.wav|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_331.wav|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_332.wav|But it can be done.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_333.wav|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_334.wav|We have to be very, very careful.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_335.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_336.wav|This could be a mistake.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_337.wav|Hopefully, this week will be good.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_338.wav|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_339.wav|I think the overall picture is still strong.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_340.wav|That is always a problem.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_341.wav|We will deliver at director level.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_342.wav|We did something about it.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_343.wav|The market is the market.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_344.wav|We do not have the papers.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_345.wav|However, the devil is in the detail.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_346.wav|For the moment, however, the position is clear.|9,,
wav48/p234/p234_347.wav|The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_348.wav|The answer was in space.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_349.wav|We are not interested in dividends.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_350.wav|Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_351.wav|His concern is only for the future.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_352.wav|And it's a goodbye from him.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_353.wav|They have to be addressed.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_354.wav|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_355.wav|However, a bid was never made.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_356.wav|That is the lesson of the last three weeks.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_357.wav|The City welcomed the numbers.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_358.wav|Something is going to have to give.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_359.wav|There's still a bit to go.|9,,,,
wav48/p234/p234_360.wav|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.|9,,,
wav48/p234/p234_361.wav|We never played at all.|9,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |10,,
wav48/p236/p236_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |10,,
wav48/p236/p236_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |10,,
wav48/p236/p236_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|10,,
wav48/p236/p236_025.wav|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_026.wav|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_027.wav|Meetings will also remain private.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_028.wav|Because we do not need it.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_029.wav|It's going to have a hell of an effect.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_030.wav|And we have a singer.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_031.wav|He was jailed for four years.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_032.wav|He should emerge as the winner.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_033.wav|This is a central issue.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_034.wav|He works at the airport.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_035.wav|It is not for any other purpose.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_036.wav|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_037.wav|It carried a double message.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_038.wav|That means an extra two years.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_039.wav|That was the case with David.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_040.wav|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_041.wav|I needed a change, a new challenge.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_042.wav|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_043.wav|Their campaign is in disarray.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_044.wav|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.|10,,
wav48/p236/p236_045.wav|We are working on it.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_046.wav|He looks like an Afghan.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_047.wav|Everything else is a bonus.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_048.wav|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_049.wav|This is the interesting part.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_050.wav|I haven't been ill at all.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_051.wav|They just thought it was extremely good acting.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_052.wav|That was the difference today.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_053.wav|We keep an eye on it.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_054.wav|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_055.wav|We felt it was sufficient.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_056.wav|You must have a government and a good civil service.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_057.wav|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.|10,,
wav48/p236/p236_058.wav|You should consider whether you want to be in this film.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_059.wav|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_060.wav|I have proved that in the past.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_061.wav|The tournament has now been cancelled.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_062.wav|I was very pleased with them today, though.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_063.wav|I was as strong as a horse.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_064.wav|Then followed a bout of flu.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_065.wav|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_066.wav|Both men were on one-year contracts.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_068.wav|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_069.wav|It is a job creation scheme.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_070.wav|He was seen as the enemy.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_071.wav|It looks like a hit.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_072.wav|These people are not big names.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_073.wav|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_074.wav|We did it for the jersey.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_075.wav|The Festival is prepared to help.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_076.wav|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.|10,,
wav48/p236/p236_077.wav|By then, he was walking on water.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_078.wav|He was just a journalist.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_079.wav|On Saturday, it was much the same.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_080.wav|They lived for their children.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_081.wav|We have turned the corner.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_083.wav|The Queen Mother is dead.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_084.wav|However, the approach is not believed to be hostile.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_085.wav|Change will however have to be in euros.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_086.wav|It was a big departure.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_087.wav|Does it matter ?|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_088.wav|How do you take them away ?|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_089.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?|10,,
wav48/p236/p236_090.wav|After the match, do you ?|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_091.wav|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_092.wav|The vast bulk of its funds are run by Aberdeen.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_093.wav|It is open season on the Old Firm.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_094.wav|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_095.wav|I had a ball today.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_096.wav|He refused to name the survivors.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_097.wav|That time is not now, however.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_098.wav|We created so many chances.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_099.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_100.wav|Our house was very small.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_101.wav|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_102.wav|It became difficult for me.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_103.wav|It's not a lack of effort.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_104.wav|It is a total and utter change of culture.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_105.wav|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_107.wav|They will notice a difference.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_108.wav|Football is a passion for many.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_109.wav|New Year will be very busy.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_110.wav|There's still plenty time left.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_111.wav|The result is a vacuum.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_112.wav|I've heard this stuff about the markets.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_113.wav|You can spend money on housing.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_114.wav|The hearing was due to continue today.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_115.wav|I can't even get into the A team.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_116.wav|In addition, investor choice is reduced.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_117.wav|But his attendance is not guaranteed.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_118.wav|Three hours later, the man was free.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_119.wav|Which can happen any time.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_120.wav|The colours are very pretty.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_121.wav|He is a lovely man.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_122.wav|Becoming a father was wonderful.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_123.wav|I was on a roll.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_124.wav|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_125.wav|Something will be done by corporate bodies.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_126.wav|He said to give a local injection.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_127.wav|They made such decisions in London.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_128.wav|You are a gambling man.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_129.wav|Before it was an ordeal.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_130.wav|I love the spectacle of cinema.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_131.wav|We will try to find someone.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_132.wav|They could use a boost.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_133.wav|She died at her home.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_134.wav|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_135.wav|I enjoy the creative process.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_136.wav|But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_137.wav|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_138.wav|It was a piece of art.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_139.wav|That view has not altered.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_140.wav|It's all change at Kilmarnock.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_141.wav|So I got a blood test.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_142.wav|It has become a way of life.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_143.wav|The whole industry is a shambles.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_144.wav|Like the others, he was arrested.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_145.wav|We will provide immediate access.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_146.wav|He could do nothing about it.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_147.wav|We have a clean bill of health.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_148.wav|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_149.wav|I was shaking on the blocks.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_151.wav|It was by the numbers.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_152.wav|It would seem a natural progression.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_153.wav|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.|10,,
wav48/p236/p236_154.wav|This action reflects a slump in bookings.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_155.wav|Being involved at that level is like an addiction.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_156.wav|It was a funny feeling.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_157.wav|I'm afraid to say anything.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_158.wav|We did what we had to do.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_159.wav|It's not like us.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_161.wav|It is not a financial issue.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_162.wav|I have got a wife to feed.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_163.wav|Seven people were later detained by police.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_164.wav|The striker needed attention before he could resume.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_165.wav|We have a budget in March.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_166.wav|He is not a team captain.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_167.wav|Greenwood said he was happy with that.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_168.wav|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_169.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_170.wav|That is not the case.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_172.wav|It's nice to be nice.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_173.wav|They could not match it.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_174.wav|Are they free ?|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_175.wav|What are they for ?|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_176.wav|Is there a waiting list ?|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_177.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_178.wav|So what happens next ?|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_179.wav|Had this been common practice ?|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_180.wav|What do they want us to do ?|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_181.wav|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_182.wav|One season, they might do well.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_183.wav|I feel like my game has come a long way.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_184.wav|The Hibs manager is no fool.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_185.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_186.wav|City sentiment is in his favour.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_187.wav|The hotel was now for sale.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_188.wav|We are the gateway to justice.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_189.wav|Tomorrow is a new day.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_190.wav|It makes no influence on the public.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_191.wav|Each case is treated on merit.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_192.wav|I have spoken to head office.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_193.wav|Says the Duke of York.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_194.wav|I had too much to drink.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_195.wav|As many as the market will support.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_196.wav|They need to look after themselves.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_197.wav|That is a waste of energy.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_198.wav|The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_199.wav|It could be argued that the council was pushed to the brink.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_200.wav|I had a train to catch.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_201.wav|It shows the strength of the roots.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_202.wav|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_203.wav|This youngster is so exciting!|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_204.wav|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_205.wav|It caused a lot of upset.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_206.wav|Motorists will buy passes in advance.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_207.wav|My duty is to win.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_208.wav|Tony Blair's official spokesman said.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_209.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_210.wav|No details of the talks were given.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_211.wav|This will be our new beginning.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_212.wav|They have the cash and the fire power.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_213.wav|The service from the other players was super.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_214.wav|The early physical reports were clear.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_215.wav|Tommy is not a problem.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_216.wav|The sanctions are about collective punishment.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_217.wav|John Daly has a burning ambition.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_218.wav|A deadline is still essential.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_219.wav|You have caught a serial killer.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_220.wav|You are a great player.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_221.wav|I won't make an official complaint.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_222.wav|It was worth a photograph.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_223.wav|They are looking at a flotation.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_224.wav|Which isn't a bad idea.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_225.wav|There is no quick fix.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_226.wav|There was a lot of resentment.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_227.wav|That might help a bit.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_228.wav|From there, they can go anywhere.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_229.wav|Death is outside the language.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_230.wav|I had relied on him.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_231.wav|The course has helped a lot.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_232.wav|I'm just a regular person.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_233.wav|It had all been arranged.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_234.wav|His third goal was superb.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_235.wav|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_236.wav|I am considered a teenager.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_237.wav|Anyway, the job will be part-time.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_238.wav|This will secure the future of our industry.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_239.wav|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_240.wav|People should make their own decisions.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_241.wav|They said that they stood by their statement.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_242.wav|You have to do your research.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_243.wav|We played them off the pitch.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_244.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_245.wav|Truth is the child of time.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_246.wav|And they were being paid ?|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_247.wav|Was everything done to save people ?|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_249.wav|Do I think about them often ?|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_250.wav|That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_251.wav|A small number of new jobs will also be created.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_252.wav|It's important to get it right.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_253.wav|Pensions are a long-term investment.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_254.wav|Those overseas offices were great.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_255.wav|On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_256.wav|Half of young people had had contact with the police.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_257.wav|I was just a kid.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_258.wav|He was good, but not that good.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_259.wav|It was quite a new prescription.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_260.wav|It is very hard for her.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_261.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_262.wav|It is believed the size of the settlement has not been finalised.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_263.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_264.wav|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_265.wav|You can feel at home in China.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_266.wav|Either way, the investor retains the premium.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_267.wav|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_268.wav|Washington is consumed by the crisis.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_269.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.|10,,
wav48/p236/p236_270.wav|But they were never expected to last.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_271.wav|However, he lasted only five days before going on the run.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_272.wav|The capital costs are modest.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_273.wav|I told you I was ill.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_274.wav|He will go on the bench.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_275.wav|That could be in place by next year.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_276.wav|We accept the new rules.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_277.wav|We run within the law.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_278.wav|We have the moral high ground.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_279.wav|He took over our lives.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_280.wav|It has all been done in secret.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_281.wav|They must play for each other.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_282.wav|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_283.wav|She always wanted her own way.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_284.wav|I realised I was lucky to have it.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_285.wav|They can leave at any time.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_286.wav|Much of the equipment was new.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_287.wav|Blair also had a penalty.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_288.wav|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_289.wav|Frankly, we should all have such problems.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_290.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_291.wav|My body is a wreck.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_292.wav|She failed in her action.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_293.wav|Stephen will get his first cap.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_294.wav|The partnership was set up during the summer.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_295.wav|And that match was played in June.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_296.wav|I saw it at a ruck.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_297.wav|What do we want to do that for ?|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_298.wav|Does the name matter ?|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_299.wav|how do you get it back ?|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_300.wav|What are you not good at ?|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_301.wav|I think, therefore I am ?|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_302.wav|It's all designed to speed up the service.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_303.wav|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_304.wav|He will address the nation this evening.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_305.wav|They have shown a great desire and attitude.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_306.wav|Maloney is an engaging talent.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_307.wav|The rescue package is public money.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_308.wav|I was there five months ago.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_309.wav|I am a retailer by nature.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_310.wav|His job was not advertised.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_311.wav|We can work all night.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_312.wav|It was really very frightening.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_313.wav|It was an excellent performance.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_314.wav|The answer is with ourselves.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_315.wav|And we can do it.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_316.wav|These figures are truly awful.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_317.wav|That is the real test.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_318.wav|They have to be addressed.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_319.wav|It aims to produce its report before Christmas.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_320.wav|Cast Away now on general release.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_321.wav|All winners should be tested.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_322.wav|I can live with it.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_323.wav|A lot has been written.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_324.wav|And he goes with it.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_325.wav|The law will take its course.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_326.wav|This is a historic occasion.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_327.wav|This ruling is a farce.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_328.wav|After some discussion they did.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_329.wav|I am not obsessed with sex.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_330.wav|I didn't have the reply.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_331.wav|Public opinion was split on the proposal.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_332.wav|These days will be back.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_333.wav|You may have a short memory.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_335.wav|There was no time scale.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_336.wav|That decision has already been made.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_337.wav|In his absence, the council adopted the change.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_338.wav|The game is now open.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_339.wav|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_340.wav|Even the one she loved.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_341.wav|Finally, he paid for the movie.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_342.wav|It was almost too much.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_343.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_344.wav|The idea was first mooted a year ago.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_345.wav|Three years ago he would have been.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_346.wav|It's a policy which has worked for us.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_347.wav|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_348.wav|The confidence isn't there now.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_349.wav|We put our bid in last night.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_350.wav|A great deal has been achieved.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_351.wav|He had no previous convictions.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_352.wav|Alex Ferguson is the same.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_353.wav|What do we do ?|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_354.wav|Why do it otherwise ?|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_355.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_356.wav|So, did she meet him ?|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_357.wav|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_358.wav|Like his acting, it was an accident.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_359.wav|Scotland is the home of golf.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_360.wav|They have broken that promise.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_361.wav|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_362.wav|It's only a matter of scale.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_363.wav|We must put a marker down.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_364.wav|She said they would appeal.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_365.wav|There is no deal as yet.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_366.wav|It's as wide as a church in here.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_367.wav|The work with Alison was a great experience.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_368.wav|It was like a weekly wage.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_369.wav|We are a Scottish company.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_370.wav|They will fight for everything.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_371.wav|The pair are very much in love.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_372.wav|We used to keep our business rates.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_373.wav|Everything is now in place for Manchester.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_374.wav|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_375.wav|Everyone could see the joke.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_376.wav|All would be under threat.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_377.wav|I understand the frustration of the fans.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_378.wav|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_379.wav|The seller was not revealed.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_380.wav|People are on the alert.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_381.wav|I can confirm that Miss Deacon has received a threatening phone call.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_382.wav|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_383.wav|A review is under way.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_384.wav|They know it'll be fantastic.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_385.wav|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_386.wav|Clark is back on top form.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_387.wav|Motion described it as a unique event.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_388.wav|It brought in new management.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_389.wav|My view has now completely changed.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_390.wav|She is in their hands.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_391.wav|The following day I used the story.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_392.wav|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_393.wav|The Cabinet is split over the issue.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_394.wav|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_395.wav|I should think so, too.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_396.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_397.wav|How are you, sir ?|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_398.wav|So is that it, then ?|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_399.wav|Do I have a favourite ?|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_400.wav|It certainly appeared that way.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_401.wav|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_402.wav|We can produce a blueprint for farmers to follow.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_403.wav|I will be able to say in a couple of weeks.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_404.wav|I remain a buyer of the shares.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_405.wav|But demand for space in Edinburgh is still strong.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_406.wav|It had been on the cards.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_407.wav|He seems to be used to the attention.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_408.wav|The trick is to try it.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_409.wav|I would love to think that she could win.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_410.wav|He may have a point.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_411.wav|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_412.wav|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_413.wav|He is on the wrong side.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_414.wav|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_415.wav|I've got my own ideas.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_416.wav|I never had a childhood.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_417.wav|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_418.wav|I think it's a miracle.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_419.wav|They were not complacent in any way.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_420.wav|They did the right thing.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_421.wav|He will be judged by his actions.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_422.wav|The fate of the rest is unknown.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_423.wav|It is an absolute nonsense.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_424.wav|Young families accounted for a growing share of the trade.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_425.wav|Sadly, the surface was a nightmare.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_426.wav|Everything in golf is a balance.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_427.wav|It is a case of pity for us.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_428.wav|I believe the gap is nearly there.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_429.wav|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.|10,,
wav48/p236/p236_430.wav|We've got a good management record.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_431.wav|It was that bad, that low.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_432.wav|Paris is not only young.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_433.wav|However, the downturn has forced the overdraft request.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_434.wav|But you can go beyond that condition.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_435.wav|But we have built a platform for next season.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_436.wav|It looked like a war zone.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_437.wav|He said current trading was strong.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_438.wav|I chose to make a film.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_439.wav|I can tell you Labour is fighting to win.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_440.wav|But by that time, it was too late.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_441.wav|The damage is all inside.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_442.wav|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_443.wav|We would have concerns about that.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_444.wav|I know the worry over Iraq.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_445.wav|Taxes may need to rise.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_446.wav|Equally the employee could claim a public interest.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_447.wav|Phil Mickelson did that last year.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_448.wav|No options are excluded at all.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_449.wav|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_450.wav|We are going for it.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_451.wav|Miss Jackson was not present to put her case.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_452.wav|It is a cause for concern.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_453.wav|The weather in the area of the crash was severe.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_454.wav|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_455.wav|He deserved a red card.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_456.wav|They were not even allowed to see them.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_457.wav|And she is very clear on this.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_458.wav|And it covers the spectrum.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_459.wav|Dennis was not so sure.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_460.wav|The chief constable has retired.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_461.wav|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_462.wav|It is a crisis, without a doubt.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_463.wav|Not if you know the person.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_464.wav|Her body was found about four miles from the car.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_465.wav|I was all image and no substance.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_466.wav|The boys are mentally focused.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_467.wav|It can all be done over the phone.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_468.wav|The bill would be massive.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_469.wav|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_470.wav|Neither woman has been named.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_471.wav|He was certainly upbeat about his chances.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_472.wav|We live by the rule of law.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_473.wav|They make a selective perception process.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_474.wav|He was a shooting star.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_475.wav|I could feel the blood on my face.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_476.wav|I am a committed European.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_477.wav|Analysts said the offer was fair.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_478.wav|These people attack the core of my beliefs.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_479.wav|Then came the farewell to Europe.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_480.wav|It is a vicious circle.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_481.wav|He will be advised by me.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_482.wav|Winning a medal is a dream.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_483.wav|We had to add value.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_484.wav|That is the bottom line.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_485.wav|It happens on an annual basis.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_486.wav|However, he emphasised the bank was satisfied with progress.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_487.wav|We have to go for a win.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_488.wav|It worked well in Monaco.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_489.wav|Something has got to change.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_490.wav|I had it before the final.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_491.wav|Our fans have been marvellous.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_492.wav|The BBC was a disgrace.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_493.wav|I would put my money on Peter Donald.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_494.wav|It was still there, but right at the end.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_495.wav|The Prime Minister has been in touch.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_496.wav|They never gave up hope.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_497.wav|He had planned to sell it.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_498.wav|I was ready for this.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_499.wav|In fact, we were all over the shop.|10,,,
wav48/p236/p236_500.wav|A Scotsman has to defend his castle.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_501.wav|Our idea is to share and lower the cost.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_502.wav|I stayed away from the defence.|10,,,,
wav48/p236/p236_503.wav|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.|10,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_001.wav|Please call Stella. |11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |11,,
wav48/p237/p237_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |11,,
wav48/p237/p237_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |11,,
wav48/p237/p237_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky. |11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |11,,
wav48/p237/p237_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|11,,
wav48/p237/p237_025.wav|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_026.wav|They should be so lucky.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_027.wav|I have a theory.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_028.wav|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_029.wav|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_030.wav|However, the following year the cancer returned.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_031.wav|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_032.wav|There's a story, too.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_033.wav|This is the window.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_034.wav|I think a move would create a lot of interest.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_035.wav|I'd like to continue that record.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_036.wav|They're just different.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_037.wav|It was clear.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_038.wav|It is not for any other purpose.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_039.wav|The problem is the pitch.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_040.wav|It's a great thing.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_041.wav|He did not know his daughter.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_042.wav|This film will be totally awesome.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_043.wav|That is a break with tradition.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_044.wav|It's the only thing.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_045.wav|It is so sad.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_046.wav|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_047.wav|It is urgent.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_048.wav|I feel pretty good.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_049.wav|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_050.wav|It is bizarre.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_051.wav|That should do it.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_052.wav|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_053.wav|She looked so young.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_054.wav|It has been a horrible, horrible time.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_055.wav|Life is good.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_056.wav|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_057.wav|I was inspired by two things.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_058.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.|11,,
wav48/p237/p237_059.wav|We were surprised to see the photograph.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_060.wav|New York is expected to come to a standstill.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_061.wav|I've had six days of rehearsal.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_062.wav|None has ever been found.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_063.wav|It's a real challenge.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_064.wav|You do not change overnight.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_065.wav|Art is extra.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_066.wav|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_067.wav|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.|11,,
wav48/p237/p237_068.wav|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_069.wav|It is like a river running by my home.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_070.wav|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_071.wav|Try to save us.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_072.wav|The end result is precisely the same.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_073.wav|There is an element of racism in Scotland.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_074.wav|Painful, but only because it's true.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_075.wav|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_076.wav|The price cuts are really exciting.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_077.wav|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_078.wav|It is a terrible place.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_079.wav|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_080.wav|It may well have been.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_081.wav|It's all going to clear the debt.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_082.wav|I first met him last summer.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_083.wav|He is driven.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_084.wav|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_085.wav|Someone who cares|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_086.wav|It's never too late.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_087.wav|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_088.wav|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_089.wav|Now the system is right behind us.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_090.wav|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_091.wav|Today I couldn't run on it.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_092.wav|However, it did not end that way.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_093.wav|We must look forward.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_094.wav|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_095.wav|Until you hit the big games.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_096.wav|We could not get any possession.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_097.wav|I love the Dome.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_098.wav|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_099.wav|By that time, however, it was already too late.|11,,
wav48/p237/p237_100.wav|They were outside the circle.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_101.wav|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_102.wav|But it was a pleasure.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_103.wav|It was some time before she found out he was safe.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_104.wav|We want to get to the final, anyway.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_105.wav|I didn't play well last year.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_106.wav|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_107.wav|They had to be cut from the wreckage.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_108.wav|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_109.wav|It is normal.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_110.wav|Further protests are likely.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_111.wav|It's in his blood.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_112.wav|Who would be right ?|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_113.wav|It's a shame.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_114.wav|I came to complete.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_117.wav|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_118.wav|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_119.wav|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_120.wav|Does this mean.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_121.wav|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_122.wav|It is a delight on every level.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_123.wav|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_124.wav|I felt very strongly that England should have it.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_125.wav|But it took a lot of bottle.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_126.wav|I thought it was a fantastic game.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_127.wav|I'm so angry.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_128.wav|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_129.wav|She really suffered for her art.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_130.wav|It's terrible that he has died the same way.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_131.wav|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_132.wav|Offered the gold medal, he declined.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_133.wav|Who will attend ?|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_134.wav|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_135.wav|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_136.wav|They made such decisions in London.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_137.wav|It's perfectly feasible.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_138.wav|They took a risk.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_139.wav|The Scottish Socialist party is also expected to attend.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_140.wav|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_141.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_142.wav|He has the edge.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_143.wav|Three penalties were given.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_144.wav|It seems so long since I did the exams.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_145.wav|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_146.wav|She hopes to study in Britain one day.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_147.wav|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_148.wav|He is severe.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_149.wav|She died at her home.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_150.wav|Is that Titanic ?|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_151.wav|The idea is simple.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_153.wav|He will emerge as a world leader.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_154.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_155.wav|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_156.wav|It is huge.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_157.wav|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_159.wav|It is not normal practice.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_160.wav|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_161.wav|We also enjoyed a lot of support.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_162.wav|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_163.wav|We are now up against it.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_164.wav|I was in daily contact.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_165.wav|He was the Bill Gates of theatre.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_166.wav|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_167.wav|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_168.wav|They should stop the bombing.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_169.wav|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_170.wav|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_171.wav|I was in the train station overnight.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_172.wav|We knew we had the goal we wanted.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_173.wav|He is keen to stay in public service.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_174.wav|I looked again at its vision for a Scottish Parliament.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_175.wav|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_176.wav|Does that put pressure on us ?|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_177.wav|The release attracted little attention.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_178.wav|Waiting times for these services are too long.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_179.wav|He was a crazy man.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_180.wav|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_181.wav|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_182.wav|One season, they might do well.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_183.wav|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_184.wav|This is a sad day.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_185.wav|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_186.wav|The hotel was now for sale.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_187.wav|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_188.wav|Government will intervene.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_189.wav|Four policemen were wounded.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_190.wav|They receive a high profile in the media.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_191.wav|It's a joke.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_192.wav|Miller was every bit as happy.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_193.wav|I wish I could say something.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_194.wav|It is tough, but possible.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_195.wav|I've got good news and bad news for you.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_196.wav|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_198.wav|If the director is with you.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_199.wav|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_200.wav|It is a case of taking a risk.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_201.wav|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_202.wav|Our strategy is straightforward.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_203.wav|Is that success ?|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_204.wav|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_205.wav|Tommy is not a problem.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_206.wav|The sisters also became the two top players in the world.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_207.wav|He was also married with two children.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_208.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.|11,,
wav48/p237/p237_210.wav|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_211.wav|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_212.wav|I don't want to use it.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_213.wav|Now, it's all right.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_214.wav|There was an e-mail.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_215.wav|Failure to react to each one could mean a disaster.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_216.wav|It is a gamble.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_217.wav|He is slightly confused.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_218.wav|She should not be blamed.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_219.wav|I began to pray.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_220.wav|I had decided to quit the show.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_221.wav|I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_222.wav|By hard work, is the answer.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_223.wav|The FBI could become involved.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_224.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_225.wav|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_226.wav|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_227.wav|You have to do your research.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_228.wav|William Hague delighted his party.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_229.wav|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_230.wav|Clearly, the stakes are high.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_231.wav|It's a question of creating a future awareness.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_232.wav|I am immensely sad.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_233.wav|I'd never seen a play about me.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_234.wav|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_235.wav|I can't wait to meet him.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_236.wav|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.|11,,
wav48/p237/p237_237.wav|They are the innocent victims.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_238.wav|Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_239.wav|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_240.wav|You take a risk.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_241.wav|They tried to give her advice.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_242.wav|Police later said the scheme would end in November.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_243.wav|It's a dead end.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_244.wav|We are in the hat.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_245.wav|Of course, that is not the whole story.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_246.wav|They should come forward.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_247.wav|It is not the message alone.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_248.wav|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_249.wav|He says that he is no different from any other man.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_250.wav|It's quite a line-up !|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_251.wav|It's a lovely, lovely film.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_252.wav|It would still have been a good film, but very different.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_253.wav|We were extremely poor.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_254.wav|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_255.wav|We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_256.wav|It would appear that it has not been a problem.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_257.wav|Chambers said he would accept the place.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_258.wav|Both reports appear in the British Medical Journal.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_259.wav|You can feel at home in China.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_260.wav|Our decision making was poor.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_262.wav|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_263.wav|They are different types.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_264.wav|There's the mix.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_265.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_266.wav|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_267.wav|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_268.wav|That could be in place by next year.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_270.wav|Special measures were needed.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_271.wav|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_272.wav|This is a big club.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_273.wav|Blair is very positive at European Councils.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_274.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_275.wav|I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_276.wav|It is also very valuable.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_277.wav|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_278.wav|The warning is timely.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_279.wav|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_280.wav|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_281.wav|There is no link.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_282.wav|This is a question of Islam.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_283.wav|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_284.wav|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_285.wav|Immediate action must be taken.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_286.wav|Frankly, we should all have such problems.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_287.wav|We're in shock.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_288.wav|You know the type.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_289.wav|She failed in her action.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_290.wav|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_291.wav|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_292.wav|They seem to get away with it.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_293.wav|People have no choice.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_294.wav|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_295.wav|I saw it at a ruck.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_296.wav|I intended to look for another club on loan.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_297.wav|Mr Campbell received a phone call.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_298.wav|Holland won by five wickets.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_299.wav|She said she could not believe that they had run away.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_300.wav|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_301.wav|That could change.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_302.wav|He should have won.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_303.wav|Who can predict ?|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_304.wav|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_305.wav|We have to sort it out ourselves.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_306.wav|I was the sheep.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_307.wav|Graeme was prepared.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_308.wav|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_309.wav|It is a road of death.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_310.wav|This is a war over our home.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_311.wav|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_312.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_313.wav|They were on holiday in Egypt.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_314.wav|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_315.wav|SCOTLAND has shown the way.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_316.wav|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_317.wav|It is no surprise.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_318.wav|We want to play at the worlds.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_320.wav|They were fantastic.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_321.wav|I never thought it would take this long.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_322.wav|They wanted the club to make money.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_323.wav|It should be equal.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_325.wav|We are very strongly behind the bid.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_326.wav|In the old days, it was easy.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_327.wav|The parents will have a great time, too.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_328.wav|It is a job creation scheme.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_329.wav|I am so upset.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_330.wav|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_331.wav|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_332.wav|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_333.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_334.wav|I saw some good things.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_335.wav|He can do no wrong.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_337.wav|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_338.wav|There was a bit of urgency in the second half.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_339.wav|They haven't got a hope.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_340.wav|It has moved on in the last week.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_341.wav|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_342.wav|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_343.wav|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_344.wav|The train was on time.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_345.wav|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_346.wav|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_347.wav|Indeed, it was magical.|11,,,
wav48/p237/p237_348.wav|Look at the witnesses.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_349.wav|Nobody else was with me.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_350.wav|The composer will conduct.|11,,,,
wav48/p237/p237_351.wav|It should be scrapped.|11,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_001.wav|Please call Stella.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|12,,
wav48/p238/p238_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|12,,,
wav48/p238/p238_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|12,,,
wav48/p238/p238_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|12,,
wav48/p238/p238_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|12,,
wav48/p238/p238_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|12,,,
wav48/p238/p238_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|12,,,
wav48/p238/p238_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|12,,,
wav48/p238/p238_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|12,,,
wav48/p238/p238_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|12,,
wav48/p238/p238_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|12,,
wav48/p238/p238_025.wav|Smoking is also very important.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_026.wav|The first appeared to be successful.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_027.wav|We must convince the citizens.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_028.wav|There was a rush of water.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_029.wav|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.|12,,,
wav48/p238/p238_030.wav|Further management changes are planned.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_031.wav|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.|12,,,
wav48/p238/p238_032.wav|The staff are very good.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_033.wav|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_034.wav|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_035.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.|12,,
wav48/p238/p238_036.wav|Let there be no doubt about that.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_037.wav|The ambition this year is to improve on last.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_038.wav|Alliance Leicester would give it a presence in southern England.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_039.wav|And so was a photograph.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_040.wav|I remember that day well.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_041.wav|She became a heroine of my childhood.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_042.wav|We want to get back into the Champions League.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_043.wav|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_044.wav|It is about regular committed giving which is the real attraction.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_045.wav|This represents a tough game for us.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_046.wav|Separate approvals would be needed for these.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_047.wav|They have shown a great desire and attitude.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_048.wav|Among them are many criminals.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_049.wav|It comes from reflection or thinking.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_050.wav|The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_051.wav|And they removed a Borderer.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_052.wav|He is too weak to move.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_053.wav|Does it matter ?|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_054.wav|How do you take them away ?|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_055.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?|12,,
wav48/p238/p238_056.wav|After the match, do you ?|12,,,
wav48/p238/p238_057.wav|Has the conflict started ?|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_058.wav|Have I really come to this ?|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_059.wav|They desperately want some stability.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_060.wav|Well, he is an artist.|12,,,
wav48/p238/p238_061.wav|We work for the athlete.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_062.wav|He looks like an Afghan.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_063.wav|Everything else is a bonus.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_064.wav|He will need that machine.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_065.wav|We hadn't really taken that seriously before.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_066.wav|It's the performance we want.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_067.wav|Then they scored two goals to win.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_068.wav|In fact, it was Geoffrey Robinson.|12,,,
wav48/p238/p238_069.wav|The partnership was set up during the summer.|12,,,,

wav48/p238/p238_318.wav|Sadly, it does not end there.|12,,,
wav48/p238/p238_319.wav|Jim has not been a problem for me at all.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_320.wav|Tell me today and I will make a business decision tomorrow.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_321.wav|We believe a third party was involved.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_322.wav|And we have the experience.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_323.wav|The early physical reports were clear.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_324.wav|Celtic were the losers then.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_325.wav|Their conclusions were never published.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_326.wav|Confidence among the allies began to slip.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_327.wav|Little is known about them.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_328.wav|Margins are also in retreat.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_329.wav|Golf is not like that.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_330.wav|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.|12,,,
wav48/p238/p238_331.wav|The move follows a review of the Singapore|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_332.wav|Which isn't a bad idea.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_333.wav|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_334.wav|They will always be in our hearts and in our minds.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_335.wav|He was admitted to hospital.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_336.wav|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_337.wav|Abbey National is an option.|12,,,,

wav48/p238/p238_342.wav|He is the son of former chairman, Lord Wolfson.|12,,,
wav48/p238/p238_343.wav|Scottish consumer protection groups were generally receptive to the proposals.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_344.wav|This is a sensible and common sense approach.|12,,,,

wav48/p238/p238_346.wav|His third goal was superb.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_347.wav|I'm very relieved that I have finally won.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_349.wav|My father died in childbirth.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_350.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?|12,,,
wav48/p238/p238_351.wav|So, did she meet him ?|12,,,
wav48/p238/p238_352.wav|So what is the campaign about ?|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_353.wav|This measure is not adjusted for seasonal factors.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_354.wav|They're going to open in early summer.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_355.wav|Anyway, the job will be part-time.|12,,,
wav48/p238/p238_356.wav|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.|12,,,
wav48/p238/p238_357.wav|And the World Cup has not even begun.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_358.wav|He remains a main board director of Royal.|12,,,,

wav48/p238/p238_361.wav|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_362.wav|It was a good workout.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_363.wav|A small number of new jobs will also be created.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_364.wav|William Hague delighted his party.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_365.wav|His background is firmly in venture capital.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_366.wav|We played them off the pitch.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_368.wav|We can have no complaints.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_369.wav|The statement contained no surprises.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_370.wav|Not that Barber has been unhappy.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_371.wav|We will likely look for new investors.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_372.wav|But the rally was short-lived.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_373.wav|But you never won any games.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_374.wav|It didn't matter who was in their way.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_375.wav|And he goes with it.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_376.wav|I have little time for analysts.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_377.wav|The most important thing in theatre is to listen.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_378.wav|It was really quite amazing.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_379.wav|It represents a complete change in emphasis.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_380.wav|It is the voice of the survivors.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_381.wav|It was cynical and callous.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_382.wav|He did not say that.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_383.wav|So is that it, then ?|12,,,
wav48/p238/p238_384.wav|Do I have a favourite ?|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_385.wav|What do we do ?|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_386.wav|Why do it otherwise ?|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_387.wav|Pensions are a long-term investment.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_388.wav|His successor was only appointed last month.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_389.wav|I've had three shots and got nowhere near.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_390.wav|It's difficult to put a date on.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_391.wav|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_392.wav|Those overseas offices were great.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_393.wav|You will have seen the adverts.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_394.wav|He was dead on arrival at hospital.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_395.wav|The problems are a result of that shortfall.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_396.wav|Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.|12,,
wav48/p238/p238_397.wav|Six games without defeat is the legacy so far.|12,,,,

wav48/p238/p238_399.wav|Colin is free to speak with other teams.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_400.wav|Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder.|12,,,
wav48/p238/p238_401.wav|He left the hospital without receiving any medication.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_402.wav|Venus rejects the very suggestion.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_403.wav|That remains the unanswered question.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_404.wav|Everything has its place and purpose.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_405.wav|Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_406.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_407.wav|And it had two seats.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_408.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_409.wav|How are you, sir ?|12,,,
wav48/p238/p238_410.wav|But nothing could be done.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_411.wav|This is a historic occasion.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_412.wav|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_413.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.|12,,,
wav48/p238/p238_414.wav|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_415.wav|Motherwell have no such good fortune.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_416.wav|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.|12,,,
wav48/p238/p238_417.wav|This would discourage investment and job creation.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_418.wav|We have no information on Iraq.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_419.wav|Either way, the investor retains the premium.|12,,,
wav48/p238/p238_420.wav|They prefer the short, intensive session.|12,,,
wav48/p238/p238_421.wav|Washington is consumed by the crisis.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_422.wav|The company declined to comment.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_423.wav|It also makes a habit of collecting people.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_424.wav|Got to get my sunglasses.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_425.wav|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_426.wav|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_427.wav|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_428.wav|Messages have to be reinforced.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_429.wav|Not many people like to do that.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_430.wav|We accept the new rules.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_431.wav|We go there with confidence.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_432.wav|It was like the old days.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_433.wav|They are interior designers and architects.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_434.wav|They can now see the rewards for working hard at the game.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_435.wav|I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.|12,,,
wav48/p238/p238_436.wav|The only problem was, they were on himself.|12,,,
wav48/p238/p238_437.wav|We are aiming for early March.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_438.wav|We discovered that for ourselves.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_439.wav|It is also very valuable.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_440.wav|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_441.wav|None of this work is guaranteed.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_442.wav|Now we see no mention of rising rates.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_443.wav|Still, some additions are inspired.|12,,,
wav48/p238/p238_444.wav|I believe we can handle this okay.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_445.wav|The whole experience was uplifting and heartbreaking at the same time.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_446.wav|Hard cash is needed now.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_447.wav|I stayed away from the defence.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_448.wav|Our performance continues to be outstanding.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_449.wav|Celtic are simply trying to buy time by not paying the money.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_450.wav|Either way, it's very funny.|12,,,
wav48/p238/p238_451.wav|It has become a way of life.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_452.wav|We didn't want any trouble.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_453.wav|It seemed a logical expansion.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_454.wav|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_455.wav|Stagecoach is seeking a new finance director.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_456.wav|Now it has doubled in size.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_458.wav|I have worked as a stand-up there often.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_459.wav|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.|12,,,,
wav48/p238/p238_460.wav|It is business as usual.|12,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_001.wav|Please call Stella.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|13,,
wav48/p239/p239_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|13,,
wav48/p239/p239_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|13,,
wav48/p239/p239_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|13,,
wav48/p239/p239_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|13,,
wav48/p239/p239_025.wav|They might have asked, for goodness sake.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_026.wav|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.|13,,
wav48/p239/p239_027.wav|And so was a photograph.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_028.wav|We are not aware of any British casualties at this stage.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_029.wav|There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_030.wav|It is about control of our economy.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_031.wav|There was a rush of water.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_032.wav|That's all I was trying to do today.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_033.wav|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_034.wav|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_035.wav|I might well have done so already.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_036.wav|That can cost him a fortune.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_037.wav|He works at the airport.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_038.wav|How do you take them away ?|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_039.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?|13,,
wav48/p239/p239_040.wav|After the match, do you ?|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_041.wav|Has the conflict started ?|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_042.wav|Have I really come to this ?|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_043.wav|This matter has still to come before the European Parliament.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_044.wav|It carried a double message.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_045.wav|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_046.wav|But not a penny has been paid.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_047.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.|13,,
wav48/p239/p239_048.wav|Alliance Leicester would give it a presence in southern England.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_049.wav|We must learn to finish.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_050.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_051.wav|New York is my home.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_052.wav|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_053.wav|I remember that day well.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_054.wav|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_055.wav|He is too weak to move.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_056.wav|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_057.wav|I feel we might now have the foundations to go forward.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_058.wav|Among them are many criminals.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_059.wav|That's been the difference between the sides.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_060.wav|And they removed a Borderer.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_061.wav|All manner of precaution and protection are taken.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_062.wav|Perhaps we should do the same.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_063.wav|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_064.wav|They were on holiday in Egypt.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_065.wav|They desperately want some stability.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_066.wav|Everything is possible in football.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_067.wav|Everyone could see the joke.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_068.wav|I'm pleased with the horse.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_069.wav|He will need that machine.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_070.wav|The new clubhouse was packed with people watching the game on TV.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_071.wav|Then they scored two goals to win.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_072.wav|In fact, it was Geoffrey Robinson.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_073.wav|Pulled a huge number of viewers.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_074.wav|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_075.wav|Let's not be too despondent.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_076.wav|The Government does not go far enough.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_077.wav|He phoned the number in the brochure.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_078.wav|I haven't got there yet.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_079.wav|I can understand the frustrations of our fans.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_080.wav|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_081.wav|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_082.wav|Labour has replaced the Tories as the party of the family.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_083.wav|But the organisers refused to worry.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_084.wav|And it had two seats.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_085.wav|Indeed, it is only the beginning.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_086.wav|Or so the theory goes.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_087.wav|He has really done well.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_088.wav|So what happens next ?|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_089.wav|Had this been common practice ?|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_090.wav|What do they want us to do ?|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_091.wav|Is it worth it ?|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_092.wav|Does it matter ?|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_093.wav|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_094.wav|But I had never been in a theatre.|13,,,,

wav48/p239/p239_101.wav|It was exactly four months away.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_102.wav|But they also noted a partial strengthening of survey evidence.|13,,,,

wav48/p239/p239_104.wav|I am so proud of him.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_105.wav|This time, it might be for real.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_106.wav|He will be kept informed.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_107.wav|There could be a way back.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_108.wav|He was a lovely man.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_109.wav|People will have to be patient.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_110.wav|I can't remember a lot of it.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_111.wav|Instead, another depression came in.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_112.wav|Talk of a crisis is absurd.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_113.wav|We have thought about doing lots of things.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_114.wav|It is sometimes like that.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_115.wav|The partners are looking for answers.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_116.wav|I've had it for the exams.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_117.wav|Those people must be accountable.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_118.wav|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_119.wav|The Festival is prepared to help.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_120.wav|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_121.wav|The error appeared in a warrant.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_122.wav|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_123.wav|Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_124.wav|He was just a journalist.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_125.wav|They lived for their children.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_126.wav|Their season has been consigned to history.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_127.wav|Diversions were put in place.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_128.wav|How independent is that ?|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_129.wav|What form did that take ?|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_130.wav|Are they free ?|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_131.wav|What are they for ?|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_132.wav|Is there a waiting list ?|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_133.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_134.wav|Maybe he has been away from British football for too long.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_135.wav|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_136.wav|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_137.wav|Gary Parker is a favourite of mine.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_138.wav|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_139.wav|It is the only practical access for vehicles and men.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_140.wav|So it was at Easter Road.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_141.wav|A move to Manchester United would be tremendous.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_142.wav|Absences should be carefully monitored.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_143.wav|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_144.wav|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_145.wav|We just have to adapt.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_146.wav|He was forced to quit.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_147.wav|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_148.wav|People have been placed in a state of alarm.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_149.wav|I was given no instructions by no-one.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_150.wav|The move follows a review of the Singapore|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_151.wav|Which isn't a bad idea.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_152.wav|Since then, things have improved.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_153.wav|That's what happened against Ayr.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_154.wav|Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_155.wav|He removed the rubble with the help of passers-by.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_156.wav|It is a good lifestyle.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_157.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_158.wav|Our relationship has been very good.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_159.wav|It was the climax of the thing.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_160.wav|Nato has left them with no other option.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_161.wav|Scottish Enterprise and the banks have been very supportive.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_162.wav|I think the referee was good.|13,,,,

wav48/p239/p239_166.wav|They exist in name alone.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_167.wav|We have reacted well to each other.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_168.wav|I can see it now.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_169.wav|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_170.wav|There's still plenty time left.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_171.wav|Those three weeks are totally lost.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_172.wav|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_173.wav|She is in good spirits.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_174.wav|As if that is an achievement.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_175.wav|Mr Blair should be warned.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_176.wav|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_177.wav|There was a fossil on screen.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_178.wav|Is it in the right place ?|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_179.wav|Did he trip ?|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_180.wav|Does that put pressure on us ?|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_181.wav|Did it work ?|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_182.wav|Do you think we are a top nation ?|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_183.wav|Here, again, they were denied a voice.|13,,
wav48/p239/p239_184.wav|Structural changes were also required.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_185.wav|His job was not advertised.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_186.wav|That was just one night.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_187.wav|This is a frightening development.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_188.wav|They keep the atmosphere in mind.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_189.wav|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_190.wav|Sloppy answers are to be avoided.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_191.wav|That is an entirely unacceptable position.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_192.wav|My father died in childbirth.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_193.wav|In addition, margins have been maintained.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_194.wav|Such an appointment could go some way to reassure investors.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_195.wav|The Yugoslav army will still be there.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_196.wav|Two years of building a business will go up in smoke.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_197.wav|You've got to be vigilant.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_198.wav|He said the director had been completely friendly.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_199.wav|Tiger is not the norm.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_200.wav|It's been a humbling year.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_201.wav|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_202.wav|Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_203.wav|It is all to do with the coaching.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_204.wav|There was a fine line to tread.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_205.wav|The refund is fully justified.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_206.wav|My wife and family are the support system.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_207.wav|We are now working with full-time on future product.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_208.wav|He has many offers from the English Premiership.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_209.wav|He is a very talented player.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_210.wav|Bottling is now the core business.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_211.wav|I would be surprised if he decided to give up.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_212.wav|The protest will go ahead as planned.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_213.wav|People have been wonderful beyond belief.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_214.wav|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_215.wav|That group reported just before Christmas.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_216.wav|We had to add value.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_217.wav|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_218.wav|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_219.wav|So I got a blood test.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_220.wav|Russell did not appeal the committee's decision.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_221.wav|I was caught out a little bit.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_222.wav|There's always the next century.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_223.wav|The business has expanded rapidly, however.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_224.wav|But it's an enjoyable job.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_225.wav|Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_226.wav|There's only one team in Ayrshire.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_227.wav|Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_228.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.|13,,
wav48/p239/p239_229.wav|Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_230.wav|She had gone to the Catholic school.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_231.wav|Then we will face the Danish champions.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_232.wav|It would seem a natural progression.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_233.wav|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_234.wav|We will turn the corner.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_235.wav|Of course, it is a tough assignment.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_236.wav|My Dad is a hero.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_237.wav|Jackie is passionate about Scotland.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_238.wav|Further details are expected later.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_239.wav|This is absolutely not true.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_240.wav|They should stop the bombing.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_241.wav|These days are long gone.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_242.wav|And they were being paid ?|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_243.wav|was everything done to save people ?|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_244.wav|What was the matter for concern ?|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_245.wav|Do I think about them often ?|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_246.wav|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_247.wav|I've learned from my mistakes.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_248.wav|Adams is surely worth a chance.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_249.wav|This season has been a mixture of frustration and fulfilment.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_250.wav|I've come here for the jersey.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_251.wav|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_252.wav|The strong performance is expected to continue.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_253.wav|The challenge for the industry is to capture and retain that talent.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_254.wav|She replied, It could be.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_255.wav|Allen is strong in every shape and form.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_256.wav|Her political persuasion is no secret.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_257.wav|We have a budget in March.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_258.wav|ADVENTURE is the champagne of life.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_259.wav|We have expanded too quickly.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_260.wav|I'd been out with my girlfriend and we were attacked.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_261.wav|Boats and other equipment would be pooled.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_262.wav|Stewart Ivory also declined to comment last night.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_263.wav|Our position remains the same.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_264.wav|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_265.wav|They could not match it.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_266.wav|He is not a pathetic figure.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_267.wav|The latter can only account for a small proportion of calls.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_268.wav|They made such decisions in London.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_269.wav|This comes down to a problem of arrogance.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_270.wav|Harrowing is easy, after all.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_271.wav|Each case is treated on merit.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_272.wav|A winter of discontent awaits.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_273.wav|I thought we were fantastic.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_274.wav|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_275.wav|It's going to be very closely watched.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_276.wav|It is fairly specialised and mainly for the export of breeding animals.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_277.wav|They receive a high profile in the media.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_278.wav|Our destiny is in our own hands.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_279.wav|Miller was every bit as happy.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_280.wav|Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.|13,,
wav48/p239/p239_281.wav|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_282.wav|There is no internal damage.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_283.wav|We've had great things in the past.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_284.wav|It could be done by experts and lawyers.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_285.wav|It has been recorded twice.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_286.wav|Aberdeen had little to offer.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_287.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_288.wav|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_289.wav|This youngster is so exciting!|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_290.wav|It was a pre-emptive strike.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_291.wav|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_292.wav|They will probably come back.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_293.wav|This is a good incentive for both parties to conclude.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_294.wav|I saw them last week.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_295.wav|Friday night was a pretty good night.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_296.wav|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_297.wav|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_298.wav|We may need to take some very radical measures.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_299.wav|Everyone can have their opinion.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_300.wav|The best thing for me was to join the Army.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_301.wav|Celtic are delaying the question of a new contract.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_302.wav|Mr McLeod said he believed a solution would be reached.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_303.wav|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_304.wav|That should give me a chance.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_305.wav|They have played their part.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_306.wav|This will be our new beginning.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_307.wav|They have the cash and the fire power.|13,,,,

wav48/p239/p239_309.wav|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_310.wav|Racism has no place in any sport.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_311.wav|Celtic were the losers then.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_312.wav|What do we want to do that for ?|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_313.wav|Does the name matter ?|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_314.wav|how do you get it back ?|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_315.wav|What are you not good at ?|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_316.wav|I think, therefore I am ?|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_317.wav|Who was she ?|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_318.wav|The result is utterly compelling.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_319.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_320.wav|I have been very nervous.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_321.wav|Confidence among the allies began to slip.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_322.wav|There were also some interesting questions and answers.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_323.wav|I won't make an official complaint.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_324.wav|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_325.wav|It wasn't about her singing, though.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_326.wav|They are looking at a flotation.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_327.wav|They make a selective perception process.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_328.wav|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_329.wav|He was admitted to hospital.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_330.wav|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_331.wav|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.|13,,,
wav48/p239/p239_332.wav|January is a bad time of year.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_333.wav|And they haven't taken the foot off the gas.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_334.wav|Royal Bank declined to comment.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_335.wav|From there, they can go anywhere.|13,,,

wav48/p239/p239_452.wav|We didn't want any trouble.|13,,,,

wav48/p239/p239_487.wav|It could well be military.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_488.wav|Holland won by five wickets.|13,,,,
wav48/p239/p239_489.wav|Other casualties were averted by the swift response of the emergency services.|13,,,,

wav48/p240/p240_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |14,,
wav48/p240/p240_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |14,,
wav48/p240/p240_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |14,,
wav48/p240/p240_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_018.wav|Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |14,,
wav48/p240/p240_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|14,,
wav48/p240/p240_025.wav|Johnson was pretty low.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_026.wav|But it failed.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_027.wav|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_028.wav|Is this accurate?|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_029.wav|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_030.wav|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_031.wav|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_032.wav|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_033.wav|This is the window.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_034.wav|People love to see this stuff.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_035.wav|He took me on a tour of the wards.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_036.wav|It is marvellous.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_037.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_038.wav|It has failed.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_039.wav|They're just different.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_040.wav|It's a real threat.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_041.wav|It was the eighties.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_042.wav|Indeed, he does.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_043.wav|President Bush is at war.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_044.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.|14,,
wav48/p240/p240_045.wav|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_046.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_047.wav|It is so sad.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_048.wav|That period was a struggle.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_049.wav|This represents a tough game for us.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_050.wav|Who can say?|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_051.wav|It's a blessing.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_052.wav|The Yugoslav president said he did not recognise the election outcome.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_053.wav|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.|14,,,

wav48/p240/p240_056.wav|He had no enemies.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_057.wav|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_058.wav|However the drama was still not at an end.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_059.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.|14,,
wav48/p240/p240_060.wav|That's the truth.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_061.wav|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_062.wav|I've had six days of rehearsal.|14,,,,

wav48/p240/p240_067.wav|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_068.wav|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_069.wav|It should be devolved.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_070.wav|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_071.wav|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.|14,,,,

wav48/p240/p240_075.wav|The girls are so lucky to be alive.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_076.wav|She died in hospital two hours later.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_077.wav|Is there a new way forward?|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_078.wav|I've got the shirt.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_079.wav|Today she has been released.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_080.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_081.wav|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_082.wav|What has changed?|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_083.wav|He is in the queue.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_084.wav|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_085.wav|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_086.wav|Someone who cares|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_087.wav|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_088.wav|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_089.wav|They lived for their children.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_090.wav|That will come after the game on Saturday.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_091.wav|Today I couldn't run on it.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_092.wav|She told The Herald.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_093.wav|We could not get any possession.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_094.wav|He is hungry for success and I am the same.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_095.wav|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_096.wav|They were outside the circle.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_097.wav|He said he hoped for a first meeting within a few days.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_098.wav|It was a good performance.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_099.wav|I see no need for change.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_100.wav|We have every respect for Michelle.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_101.wav|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_102.wav|He takes the job.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_103.wav|They will want to perform well.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_104.wav|That all hope is never lost.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_105.wav|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_106.wav|Getting new people interested in this music is the real reward.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_107.wav|It's in his blood.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_108.wav|It's a shame.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_109.wav|It had been played at festivals.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_110.wav|I came to complete.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_111.wav|It's a question of perception.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_112.wav|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_113.wav|This film will be totally awesome.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_114.wav|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_115.wav|I'm delighted about that.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_116.wav|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_117.wav|I joined a group.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_118.wav|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_119.wav|She really suffered for her art.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_120.wav|It is a delight on every level.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_121.wav|You can spend money on housing.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_122.wav|There were no grounds for his action.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_123.wav|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_124.wav|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_125.wav|I was furious.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_126.wav|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_127.wav|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_128.wav|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_129.wav|I do not think this family will ever get over this.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_130.wav|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_131.wav|Offered the gold medal, he declined.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_132.wav|It was the same at Twickenham.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_133.wav|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_134.wav|It is also well received.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_135.wav|Government will intervene.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_136.wav|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_137.wav|He was in a great deal of pain.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_138.wav|We want to keep the pound.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_139.wav|It seems so long since I did the exams.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_140.wav|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_141.wav|Wallace was a prisoner of war.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_142.wav|Who would be right?|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_143.wav|She died at her home.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_144.wav|I am just trying to do my job.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_145.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_146.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_147.wav|They did very well.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_148.wav|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_149.wav|It was deployed in the Gulf War.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_150.wav|It's amazing, but I have never seen a drug test in Scotland.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_151.wav|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_152.wav|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_153.wav|Mr Blair had done well.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_154.wav|I was in daily contact.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_155.wav|My Dad is a hero.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_156.wav|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_157.wav|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_158.wav|Was this element always there?|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_159.wav|These days are long gone.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_160.wav|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_161.wav|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_162.wav|I was in the train station overnight.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_163.wav|We knew we had the goal we wanted.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_164.wav|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_165.wav|Tell it like it was?|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_166.wav|We have a budget in March.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_167.wav|That must be left to the Parole Board.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_168.wav|By then, however, both men were already in the US.|14,,
wav48/p240/p240_169.wav|They will do their own thing.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_170.wav|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_171.wav|It's quite a routine.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_172.wav|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_173.wav|The hotel was now for sale.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_174.wav|I drove the ball well.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_175.wav|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_176.wav|They know no other way.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_177.wav|There is no point in looking any further.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_178.wav|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_179.wav|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.|14,,
wav48/p240/p240_180.wav|They will run a mile.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_181.wav|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_182.wav|They need to look after themselves.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_183.wav|Miller was every bit as happy.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_184.wav|What has caused the demise of singing?|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_185.wav|We want to help them through it.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_186.wav|They really did a great job.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_187.wav|It was an odd affair, in many respects.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_188.wav|It is tough, but possible.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_189.wav|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_190.wav|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_191.wav|The procedure is the same in all cases.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_192.wav|People will ask about us.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_193.wav|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_194.wav|It is a farce.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_195.wav|I am totally surprised.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_196.wav|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_197.wav|It wasn't to be.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_198.wav|There was no option.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_199.wav|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_200.wav|But we are not immune to the problem.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_201.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_202.wav|Who will pay for this?|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_203.wav|They've got three-quarters of the way.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_204.wav|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_205.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.|14,,
wav48/p240/p240_206.wav|It's all about money, money, money.|14,,
wav48/p240/p240_207.wav|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_208.wav|It's a mixture of everything.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_209.wav|We have an election in eight days.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_210.wav|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_211.wav|We'll have to work hard today.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_212.wav|She should not be blamed.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_213.wav|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.|14,,
wav48/p240/p240_214.wav|It had all been arranged.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_215.wav|A Grampian Police spokesman said.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_216.wav|His third goal was superb.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_217.wav|I was so nervous.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_218.wav|Work has started.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_219.wav|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_220.wav|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_221.wav|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_222.wav|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_223.wav|That has been the easy part.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_224.wav|Women were mostly notable by their absence.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_225.wav|But it will be sorted out this week.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_226.wav|What was the main difference?|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_227.wav|I am immensely sad.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_228.wav|It is a gamble.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_229.wav|At the time, he was a living legend.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_230.wav|It's so special.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_231.wav|They are the innocent victims.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_232.wav|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_233.wav|The body follows the mind.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_234.wav|However, no further action was taken by police.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_235.wav|And thought we would get away with it.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_236.wav|Jobs could go.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_237.wav|It is not the message alone.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_238.wav|It's quite a line-up!|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_239.wav|It's very safe.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_240.wav|But it's a subtle process.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_241.wav|Of further privacy, he had no need.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_242.wav|He was good, but not that good.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_243.wav|We were extremely poor.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_244.wav|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_245.wav|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_246.wav|It is hard won.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_247.wav|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_248.wav|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_249.wav|I am the opposite because I haven't played very much.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_250.wav|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_251.wav|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_252.wav|He got the same story.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_253.wav|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_254.wav|I have a lot of relatives in this part of the country.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_255.wav|A friendship that will endure.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_256.wav|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_257.wav|Her presence was almost everywhere.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_258.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_259.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_260.wav|Blair is very positive at European Councils.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_261.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_262.wav|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.|14,,
wav48/p240/p240_263.wav|I was happily surprised.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_264.wav|They must play for each other.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_265.wav|It is also very valuable.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_266.wav|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.|14,,
wav48/p240/p240_267.wav|Blood samples were taken.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_268.wav|There is no link.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_269.wav|This is a question of Islam.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_270.wav|It looks as though he will be right.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_271.wav|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_272.wav|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_273.wav|Have a look at our accounts.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_274.wav|He was also married with two children.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_275.wav|And Michael was just great.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_276.wav|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_277.wav|Access has been a nightmare.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_278.wav|It has been achieved by hard work and careful planning.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_279.wav|It's a way of life.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_280.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_281.wav|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_282.wav|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_283.wav|People have no choice.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_284.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_285.wav|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_286.wav|If not, he should go home.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_288.wav|His mother refuses to believe that she is dead.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_289.wav|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_290.wav|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.|14,,
wav48/p240/p240_291.wav|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_292.wav|He will address the nation this evening.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_293.wav|It was a virus.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_294.wav|Maloney is an engaging talent.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_295.wav|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_296.wav|It's like a high school play.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_297.wav|Who did the recruiting?|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_298.wav|He was obviously very genuine.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_299.wav|She said she could not believe that they had run away.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_300.wav|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_301.wav|A new school will be built.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_302.wav|We have to sort it out ourselves.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_303.wav|He said she was mad.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_304.wav|I was the sheep.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_305.wav|There was no hint of scandal.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_306.wav|The home was now under new management.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_307.wav|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_308.wav|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_309.wav|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_310.wav|We do not expect any surplus.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_311.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_312.wav|The plot is minimal.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_313.wav|And he goes with it.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_314.wav|SCOTLAND has shown the way.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_315.wav|It is no surprise.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_316.wav|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_317.wav|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_318.wav|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_319.wav|They were fantastic.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_320.wav|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_321.wav|We are a peaceful people.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_322.wav|The election is total confusion and chaos.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_323.wav|Henman has been warned.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_324.wav|Craig is a major concern for us.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_325.wav|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_326.wav|It is out there.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_327.wav|Referees are easy targets.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_328.wav|They had a confession.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_329.wav|We do the same.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_330.wav|That's the law of the land.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_331.wav|Donald was his friend.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_332.wav|I am so upset.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_333.wav|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_334.wav|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_335.wav|The police have to act to help them.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_336.wav|We agreed to disagree.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_337.wav|It could have gone either way.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_338.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_339.wav|I saw some good things.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_340.wav|I've not thought about it.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_341.wav|Who was the mystery MP?|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_342.wav|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_343.wav|It is a sign of hope.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_344.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_345.wav|Three years ago he would have been.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_346.wav|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.|14,,
wav48/p240/p240_347.wav|It is so unfair.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_348.wav|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_349.wav|He has to learn.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_351.wav|Look at the witnesses.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_352.wav|That is the very reason why it was so vital.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_353.wav|However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_354.wav|The composer will conduct.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_355.wav|This is a friendly match?|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_357.wav|They should take their mobile phones.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_358.wav|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_359.wav|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_360.wav|He had played well in that central role.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_361.wav|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_362.wav|That is a break with tradition.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_363.wav|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_364.wav|The council said the house would have to be demolished.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_365.wav|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_366.wav|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_367.wav|As, indeed, they would be.|14,,
wav48/p240/p240_368.wav|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_369.wav|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_370.wav|Hartley should know.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_371.wav|That would help.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_372.wav|A deadline is still essential.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_373.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_374.wav|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_375.wav|We are looking for perfection.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_376.wav|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.|14,,,
wav48/p240/p240_377.wav|He later became a respected High Court judge.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_378.wav|It's been hard.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_379.wav|It's now down in black and white.|14,,,,
wav48/p240/p240_380.wav|Safety was also an issue.|14,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_001.wav|Please call Stella. |15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |15,,
wav48/p241/p241_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |15,,
wav48/p241/p241_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |15,,
wav48/p241/p241_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |15,,
wav48/p241/p241_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|15,,
wav48/p241/p241_025.wav|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_026.wav|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_027.wav|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_028.wav|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_029.wav|However, the following year the cancer returned.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_030.wav|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|15,,
wav48/p241/p241_031.wav|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_032.wav|This is the window.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_033.wav|People love to see this stuff.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_034.wav|And we have a singer.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_035.wav|He took me on a tour of the wards.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_036.wav|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_037.wav|It's nice to hear.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_038.wav|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.|15,,
wav48/p241/p241_039.wav|It is not for any other purpose.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_040.wav|President Bush is at war.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_041.wav|It was ugly.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_042.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_043.wav|That period was a struggle.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_044.wav|This represents a tough game for us.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_045.wav|We need to chat.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_046.wav|That time has passed.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_047.wav|As she explains.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_048.wav|He is too weak to move.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_049.wav|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_050.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_051.wav|He looks like an Afghan.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_052.wav|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_053.wav|However the drama was still not at an end.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_055.wav|Next league matches Celtic.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_056.wav|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_057.wav|What was the main difference?|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_058.wav|I was an athlete.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_059.wav|There was a battle there.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_061.wav|It was all in a short period of time.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_062.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_063.wav|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.|15,,
wav48/p241/p241_064.wav|The script was funny.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_065.wav|He could make it.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_066.wav|Try to save us.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_067.wav|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_068.wav|There is an element of racism in Scotland.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_069.wav|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_070.wav|The company yesterday refused to comment.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_071.wav|He highlighted a lack of staff.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_072.wav|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_073.wav|Both sides have been hit by injury.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_074.wav|The girls are so lucky to be alive.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_075.wav|It is a job creation scheme.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_076.wav|He is now resident in England.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_077.wav|Even the one she loved.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_078.wav|I've got the shirt.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_079.wav|This is the way things should be handled.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_080.wav|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_081.wav|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_082.wav|I first met him last summer.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_083.wav|Nothing is yet confirmed.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_084.wav|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.|15,,,

wav48/p241/p241_087.wav|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.|15,,,,

wav48/p241/p241_090.wav|The city council is a major property owner in the area.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_091.wav|Now the system is right behind us.|15,,,,

wav48/p241/p241_093.wav|A council spokesman said that they could not comment on the issue.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_094.wav|Motherwell have no such good fortune.|15,,,,

wav48/p241/p241_096.wav|The peace process will be buried!|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_098.wav|I love the Dome.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_099.wav|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_100.wav|It was mayhem.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_101.wav|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_102.wav|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_103.wav|We want to get to the final, anyway.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_104.wav|They will want to perform well.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_105.wav|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.|15,,
wav48/p241/p241_106.wav|I'm not depressed.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_107.wav|It was his job to check.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_108.wav|Is that right?|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_109.wav|You had better believe it.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_110.wav|We want to help them through it.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_111.wav|It's not a new concept in jazz.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_112.wav|The breakdown was much later in her life.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_113.wav|It's not fair.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_114.wav|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_115.wav|He will emerge as a world leader.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_116.wav|I'm delighted about that.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_117.wav|I joined a group.|15,,,,

wav48/p241/p241_144.wav|That group reported just before Christmas.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_145.wav|I am just trying to do my job.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_146.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.|15,,,

wav48/p241/p241_153.wav|Neither side can win this war.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_154.wav|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_155.wav|Was this element always there?|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_157.wav|It was so new, so exciting.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_158.wav|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_159.wav|I've put my own money into this project.|15,,,,

wav48/p241/p241_190.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_191.wav|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_192.wav|I wanted to put myself on the line.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_193.wav|Off I went.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_195.wav|It's the same old story.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_196.wav|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_197.wav|Is that success?|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_198.wav|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_199.wav|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_200.wav|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_202.wav|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_203.wav|He's not perfect.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_204.wav|They've got three-quarters of the way.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_205.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.|15,,
wav48/p241/p241_206.wav|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_207.wav|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_208.wav|I don't want to use it.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_209.wav|But I am a worried man.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_210.wav|He knows a lot.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_211.wav|It had all been arranged.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_212.wav|A Grampian Police spokesman said.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_213.wav|His third goal was superb.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_214.wav|It's been a good year.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_215.wav|We want to keep the pound.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_216.wav|I was so nervous.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_217.wav|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_218.wav|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_219.wav|IT S the real thing, for sure.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_220.wav|A career as a doctor is on hold.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_221.wav|You have to do your research.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_222.wav|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_223.wav|We played them off the pitch.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_224.wav|But it will be sorted out this week.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_225.wav|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_226.wav|My neighbours are horrified.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_227.wav|The track is currently covered in snow.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_228.wav|Who would be right?|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_229.wav|It is set in Paris.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_230.wav|It is not the message alone.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_231.wav|Well, they were the unlucky ones.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_232.wav|Hospitals are for the ill.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_233.wav|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_234.wav|We have a free vote on these things in our party.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_235.wav|We were extremely poor.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_236.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_237.wav|We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_238.wav|It is hard won.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_239.wav|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_240.wav|Chambers said he would accept the place.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_241.wav|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_242.wav|In fact, we were all over the shop.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_243.wav|The scene is about this?|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_244.wav|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_245.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_246.wav|They are different types.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_247.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_248.wav|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_249.wav|This is the culture change in medicine.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_250.wav|Her presence was almost everywhere.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_251.wav|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.|15,,
wav48/p241/p241_252.wav|Special measures were needed.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_253.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_254.wav|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_255.wav|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_256.wav|They are real.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_257.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_258.wav|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_259.wav|That's the only thing I will say.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_260.wav|It was good fun.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_261.wav|It looks as though he will be right.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_262.wav|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_264.wav|Immediate action must be taken.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_265.wav|It's very nice.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_266.wav|It left me with a sadness.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_267.wav|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_268.wav|And Michael was just great.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_269.wav|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_270.wav|Access has been a nightmare.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_271.wav|But he is caught between a rock and a hard place.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_272.wav|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_273.wav|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_274.wav|It was a privilege to work for him.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_275.wav|It's so awful.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_276.wav|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_277.wav|We are a grandmother.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_278.wav|We have to break that cycle.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_279.wav|I saw it at a ruck.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_280.wav|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_281.wav|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_282.wav|Yet, it worked.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_283.wav|I should think so, too.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_284.wav|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_285.wav|The death toll included five children.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_286.wav|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_287.wav|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_288.wav|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_289.wav|It changed my life.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_290.wav|A new school will be built.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_291.wav|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_292.wav|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_293.wav|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_294.wav|What has altered?|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_295.wav|However, the snow was welcomed by some.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_296.wav|It just came into my head that day.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_297.wav|Our task is to complete the picture.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_298.wav|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_299.wav|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_300.wav|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_301.wav|This is a war over our home.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_302.wav|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_303.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_304.wav|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_305.wav|And he goes with it.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_306.wav|SCOTLAND has shown the way.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_307.wav|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_308.wav|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_309.wav|Is there on his hands?|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_310.wav|It was a question of patience.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_311.wav|I was rubbish.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_312.wav|Kids are terrible.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_313.wav|It should be equal.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_314.wav|Craig is a major concern for us.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_315.wav|The home team had an amazing start.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_317.wav|It is out there.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_319.wav|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_320.wav|We think all other measures are not exhausted.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_321.wav|In his absence, the council adopted the change.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_322.wav|It is a strong case.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_323.wav|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_324.wav|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_325.wav|I think I was recorded with a video camera.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_326.wav|We agreed to disagree.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_327.wav|I'd like to take the plunge.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_328.wav|My first concern is for the safety of the public.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_329.wav|I've not thought about it.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_330.wav|Who was the mystery MP?|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_331.wav|It's been hard.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_332.wav|They should stop the bombing.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_333.wav|Who will do it?|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_334.wav|However, Sharon rejected the claims.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_336.wav|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_337.wav|I must make that clear.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_338.wav|The train was on time.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_340.wav|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_342.wav|I would miss him.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_343.wav|Tiger is the exception.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_344.wav|I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_345.wav|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_346.wav|His contract was then not renewed.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_347.wav|I got a yellow card.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_349.wav|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_350.wav|There is a cup final at stake.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_351.wav|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_352.wav|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_353.wav|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_354.wav|As, indeed, they would be.|15,,
wav48/p241/p241_356.wav|It benefits the whole family.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_357.wav|Our numbers are small.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_358.wav|That would help.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_359.wav|So I left.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_360.wav|We are looking for perfection.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_362.wav|This is a club on the rise.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_363.wav|Equity declined to comment.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_364.wav|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_365.wav|The play is based on a real-life event.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_366.wav|He could face a jail sentence.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_368.wav|He put some colour into Scottish history.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_369.wav|There was no hint of scandal.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_370.wav|Safety was also an issue.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_371.wav|Well, the big day has arrived.|15,,,
wav48/p241/p241_372.wav|By that time, however, it was already too late.|15,,
wav48/p241/p241_373.wav|Talks are progressing.|15,,,,
wav48/p241/p241_374.wav|There is no signature.|15,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_001.wav|Please call Stella. |16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |16,,
wav48/p243/p243_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |16,,
wav48/p243/p243_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |16,,
wav48/p243/p243_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |16,,
wav48/p243/p243_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|16,,
wav48/p243/p243_025.wav|He has the right attitude but the wrong approach.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_026.wav|His secretary said it was a matter for Murray Financial to deal with.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_027.wav|I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_028.wav|The west coast line is not just for middle England.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_029.wav|The Budget is a boost for Scottish business.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_030.wav|She brought a lot to my life.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_031.wav|Things fall a little flat elsewhere, however.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_032.wav|Thomson and his family left court without comment.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_033.wav|I want to give everything to Rangers while I am with the club.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_034.wav|But the Sunday Herald said it stood by its story.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_035.wav|It is about control of our economy.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_036.wav|Each brand was owned by a different family.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_037.wav|That was not perfect golf by any means.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_038.wav|He added that her comments were noted.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_039.wav|She will get through it I'm sure.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_040.wav|Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_041.wav|Hearts hit back with two goals in four minutes.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_042.wav|He does not even trust his own members.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_043.wav|He too started on the subs seats.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_044.wav|Is it worth it ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_045.wav|Does it matter ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_046.wav|How do you take them away ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_047.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?|16,,
wav48/p243/p243_048.wav|After the match, do you ?|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_049.wav|Has the conflict started ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_050.wav|Have I really come to this ?|16,,,,

wav48/p243/p243_057.wav|Her husband had been waiting for her return.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_058.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_059.wav|We just want this season to end.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_060.wav|It was a day she thought she would never see.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_061.wav|Talks have continued at many different levels.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_062.wav|The referee is there to decide these things.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_063.wav|There were no details of the other five victims.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_064.wav|It also has a good labour supply.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_065.wav|Indeed he has a lot of output.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_066.wav|Do not give your details to anyone.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_067.wav|He was failed by his health authority.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_068.wav|But it was not all bad news.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_069.wav|I cannot believe that someone would pay so much for works like these.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_070.wav|But during the bid process, that changed completely.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_071.wav|It turned me against the whole system.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_072.wav|She seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_073.wav|I saw the story, but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_074.wav|But two groups refused to sign up.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_075.wav|I was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_076.wav|It had little effect on European equity markets.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_077.wav|I'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_078.wav|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_079.wav|The squad spent the night at police headquarters.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_080.wav|They said our costs were too high.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_081.wav|I do not attempt to answer that.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_082.wav|It's been a great evening for us.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_083.wav|That kind of growth is the important thing.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_084.wav|A regular bus service runs between the hall and the town centre.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_085.wav|No plan for projects are yet in place.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_086.wav|Clearly he knows nothing about Glasgow or Glasgow Green.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_087.wav|I have no problems playing with such capable players in front of me.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_088.wav|Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_089.wav|I feel I did not have enough time.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_090.wav|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_091.wav|I can't remember a lot about the accident.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_092.wav|Clark was delighted with the effort of Jones.|16,,,,

wav48/p243/p243_094.wav|There is no issue of national security involved here.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_095.wav|He will be a very hard act to follow.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_096.wav|Earlier, both main parties had agreed a crucial stage had been reached.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_097.wav|Put simply, it goes something like this.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_098.wav|Over one million people have been forced from their homes.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_099.wav|Even if he doesn't have any lines.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_100.wav|I am delighted to hear this news.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_101.wav|We are already seeing some positive results.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_102.wav|We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_103.wav|We were under a bit of pressure.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_104.wav|They won't actually make any money from it.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_105.wav|I bought a flat six years ago.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_106.wav|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_107.wav|They are a different team at home.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_108.wav|It took around three minutes from beginning to end.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_109.wav|Scotland is never far away at Westminster.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_110.wav|Some young girls also came by last night.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_111.wav|Former Hamilton defender Colin Miller could return to the club today as manager.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_112.wav|What are they for ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_113.wav|Is there a waiting list ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_114.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_115.wav|So what happens next ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_116.wav|Had this been common practice ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_117.wav|What do they want us to do ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_118.wav|The idea is the shop within a shop.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_119.wav|I left five minutes after he had finished his round.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_120.wav|It is the right package for Scotland.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_121.wav|They have no real friends in the region.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_122.wav|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_123.wav|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_125.wav|I think there's not much between them.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_126.wav|So I am going in the right direction.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_127.wav|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_128.wav|We have to offer value for money.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_129.wav|It's so nice to see the reaction on their faces.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_130.wav|I could live without the attention, he admitted.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_131.wav|He's got to look after himself now.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_132.wav|He said a review of the planning process should encourage fresh thinking.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_133.wav|No country has a similar training programme.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_134.wav|There is no future in rock music.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_135.wav|Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_136.wav|Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_137.wav|The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_138.wav|We must pay teachers to take rugby in schools.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_139.wav|The programme has been made with great care.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_140.wav|There was only one living room, you see.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_141.wav|I am not under any new pressure.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_142.wav|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_143.wav|It appears that no holiday is complete without a good row.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_144.wav|They can break quickly from midfield and carry a scoring threat.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_145.wav|All eight victims were based in Germany.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_146.wav|Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_147.wav|You should feel involved in their lives.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_148.wav|It is open season on the Old Firm.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_149.wav|Is it in the right place ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_150.wav|Did he trip ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_151.wav|Does that put pressure on us ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_152.wav|Did it work ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_153.wav|Do you think we are a top nation ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_154.wav|Three senior officials were dismissed last week.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_155.wav|Time may already have run out for this option.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_156.wav|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_157.wav|When it happened, he could hardly believe it.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_158.wav|They let you see the world through a fresh pair of eyes.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_159.wav|As our national coach, Brown is done for.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_160.wav|A progress report will be published in October.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_161.wav|This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_162.wav|That will reduce my chance of selection.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_163.wav|When Germany played there recently, the match took place in the new stadium.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_164.wav|Surely it can't run for two years.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_165.wav|But the game is still wide open.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_166.wav|It is no good thinking about Rangers at this time.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_167.wav|However, it's possible that Dick can influence some Dutch players to go there.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_168.wav|I knew that I needed to lower my ball flight.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_169.wav|We had to work very hard for our points.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_170.wav|That is a big risk at any price.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_171.wav|You need a long-term strategy in football.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_172.wav|He said some things which were better left alone.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_173.wav|If successful, several records will be made.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_174.wav|The company hopes to top seven million passengers in its current financial year.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_175.wav|It didn't come as any great surprise.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_176.wav|Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_177.wav|It's just a different way of life.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_178.wav|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_179.wav|Nato has left them with no other option.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_180.wav|I am secure in my own position.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_181.wav|Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_182.wav|She is believed to be in South Africa.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_183.wav|The answer I hope includes the Government - Holyrood and Westminster.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_184.wav|We have come a long way since then.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_185.wav|I made my mind up before we came on tour.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_186.wav|A great player has to win major championships.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_187.wav|Highland health board has a responsibility here.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_188.wav|I didn't miss the big house at all.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_189.wav|The story was not made public by this club.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_190.wav|That capital would be provided equally by the State and established commercial companies.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_191.wav|You are not long home from work.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_192.wav|I am fighting the force of nature.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_193.wav|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_194.wav|Murray spent the early part of his career elsewhere.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_195.wav|And they were being paid ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_196.wav|was everything done to save people ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_197.wav|What was the matter for concern ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_198.wav|But they had to be paid for.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_199.wav|There was no way back for Rangers after that blow.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_200.wav|The police insisted that they were standard issue.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_201.wav|One in eight workers in Edinburgh works for Standard Life alone.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_202.wav|I've never had a year like this.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_203.wav|Full details are expected to be released in June.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_204.wav|As you see with the fuel duty business, they do.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_205.wav|Hague will be leader at the election after next.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_206.wav|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_207.wav|I want an answer from the British Government.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_208.wav|Gas production was also at record levels last year.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_209.wav|They are a victim of their own success.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_210.wav|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_211.wav|This is a young squad and we're all supporters.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_212.wav|It is going to change the world.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_213.wav|Scottish football yesterday appeared ready to line up alongside the Scotland manager.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_214.wav|People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_215.wav|The study is entirely into the issue of future funding.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_216.wav|I am not going to judge them.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_217.wav|I do not see this so much as failure.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_218.wav|A European final must be the millennium target.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_219.wav|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_220.wav|I was independent but I am not now.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_221.wav|We hope for a fresh board with a fresh, clear look at things.|16,,,

wav48/p243/p243_226.wav|If not, a deal could take many months.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_227.wav|This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_228.wav|Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_229.wav|I want to see as much progress as possible.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_230.wav|This is certainly not the time for attempts at trial by media.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_231.wav|I felt we played some excellent football in the first half.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_232.wav|The mother and daughter had moved into the property about six months ago.|16,,,,

wav48/p243/p243_235.wav|You are not allowed to do that.|16,,,,

wav48/p243/p243_240.wav|Was it the wife ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_241.wav|Why change it ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_242.wav|What do we want to do that for ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_243.wav|Does the name matter ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_244.wav|how do you get it back ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_245.wav|What are you not good at ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_246.wav|I think, therefore I am ?|16,,,

wav48/p243/p243_248.wav|The pair will meet again in Glasgow, and then train together in Australia.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_249.wav|My first New Year's wish is for him to change his mind.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_250.wav|He has many offers from the English Premiership.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_251.wav|However, the figures tell a different story.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_252.wav|The rise has come too late for some.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_253.wav|Rangers then had a couple of good efforts.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_254.wav|I'd rather play well next week than here.|16,,,,

wav48/p243/p243_287.wav|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_288.wav|No-one had seen this sort of thing before.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_289.wav|We played well at Aberdeen, though we lost.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_290.wav|He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_291.wav|He would get into any world team.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_292.wav|Its work includes dealing with child abuse.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_293.wav|They first met during a Step in London.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_294.wav|The agreement remains the only show in town.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_295.wav|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_296.wav|The strong performance is expected to continue.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_297.wav|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_298.wav|It is based on population rather than need.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_299.wav|He could understand both points of view.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_300.wav|So, did she meet him ?|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_301.wav|So what is the campaign about ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_302.wav|And does it ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_303.wav|Are you from the rugby ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_304.wav|Had I heard ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_305.wav|What happened in that game ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_306.wav|Are you going to win ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_308.wav|Further heavy charges are expected this year.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_309.wav|It happened on average once a week this year.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_310.wav|This is the version which appeared in our paper.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_311.wav|He is keen to stay in public service.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_312.wav|Of course people will try the things they see on TV.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_313.wav|For that reason cover should not be given.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_314.wav|He felt too close to head office.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_315.wav|If you believe in the blue and white.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_316.wav|A report on their property is due within days.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_317.wav|He will just go on doing his job.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_318.wav|I always felt they played for me.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_319.wav|That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_320.wav|The team spirit that was here last year is again good.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_321.wav|This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_322.wav|We will not simply hit these people.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_323.wav|We still think this trade is on the increase.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_324.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_325.wav|His name was first linked last year to Business for Scotland.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_326.wav|I feel as if I can hole everything now.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_327.wav|I try to be open to experience.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_328.wav|He is not exactly a pretty child.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_329.wav|I thought the race was a little bit slow.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_330.wav|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_331.wav|Having a Scot play against us would not achieve that.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_332.wav|I felt it was time for me to leave to develop my career.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_333.wav|These options include the possible merger or sale of the company.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_334.wav|One royal, however, was himself criticised yesterday.|16,,
wav48/p243/p243_335.wav|Sports Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the action.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_336.wav|I hope numbers will be up on last time.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_337.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_338.wav|How are you, sir ?|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_339.wav|So is that it, then ?|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_340.wav|Do I have a favourite ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_341.wav|Put another way, they just won't do it.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_342.wav|Perhaps she met her husband too early, she says.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_343.wav|Getting that balance right can be very difficult.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_344.wav|Martin O Neill called this game almost exactly right.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_345.wav|Neither police nor hotel management had any record of the incident.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_346.wav|It was a bit like having children.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_347.wav|And the top prize draw award is certainly impressive.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_348.wav|And that is the bottom line - box office.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_349.wav|I'm extremely confident something will happen within the next couple of days.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_350.wav|I think the guilty ones speak for the whole lot of us.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_352.wav|Sales will begin by the end of October.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_353.wav|The executive has so far not offered any immediate prospect of major change.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_354.wav|Friday night was a pretty good night.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_355.wav|It is not a material issue for a group with our strength.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_356.wav|The deal is expected to be completed by September.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_357.wav|It is the only natural British site on the list.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_358.wav|His style was direct and very human.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_359.wav|Under Alex Ferguson, Aberdeen showed it could be done.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_360.wav|They have the cash and the fire power.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_361.wav|The institute board will take the decision.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_362.wav|He's young enough and he must learn.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_363.wav|Such a policy is for long-term strength.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_364.wav|Both players gave so much to the side.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_365.wav|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_366.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_367.wav|The dead woman and the injured man have not yet been named.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_368.wav|It was a goal which came from nothing.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_369.wav|We have a substantial value of assets on the ground.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_370.wav|I have come here to show support for the families.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_371.wav|We have been going for three years.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_372.wav|He really played us into a corner.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_373.wav|They know the truth, they really know the truth.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_374.wav|It was another black day for Ayrshire.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_375.wav|Otherwise, we might as well hold it now.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_376.wav|It used to be all hard sell.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_377.wav|The direct effects on trade will be limited.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_378.wav|He had got himself into trouble with money and needed money.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_379.wav|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_380.wav|This is an audience determined to enjoy themselves.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_381.wav|This is not a small amount of money.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_382.wav|The doctors say that he will be fine for the performance next week.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_383.wav|I just felt that I was broken down.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_384.wav|What do we do ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_385.wav|Why do it otherwise ?|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_386.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_387.wav|The cost of this failure will not hit the Commission.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_388.wav|Similar increases have been experienced by the medical defence unions.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_389.wav|He remains a main board director of Royal.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_390.wav|His record on Government has always been highly effective.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_391.wav|My tax affairs have been totally open.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_392.wav|Five years ago its return was rejected.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_393.wav|But soon the game dropped back into its old ways.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_394.wav|In my opinion, any transfer to a foreign club will help him progress.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_395.wav|In that situation, they thought we should be beaten.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_396.wav|We are keen to see truth and justice.|16,,,,
wav48/p243/p243_397.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.|16,,,
wav48/p243/p243_398.wav|People have a wish to charge twice.|16,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_001.wav|Please call Stella. |17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |17,,
wav48/p244/p244_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |17,,
wav48/p244/p244_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |17,,
wav48/p244/p244_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |17,,
wav48/p244/p244_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|17,,
wav48/p244/p244_025.wav|We are a service industry.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_026.wav|It may be good for the soul.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_027.wav|We want to lift the cup for the fans.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_028.wav|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_029.wav|It is about investing in the future.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_030.wav|However, the following year the cancer returned.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_031.wav|They were in good humour, too.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_032.wav|The end result is the same.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_033.wav|It is on the internet.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_034.wav|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_035.wav|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_036.wav|This is a central issue.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_037.wav|History is in the making.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_038.wav|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_039.wav|She was there for the start of the campaign.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_040.wav|She was at the top.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_041.wav|In London today, it was business as usual.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_042.wav|And they had a case.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_043.wav|Something has to be put in place.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_044.wav|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_045.wav|They are going after them.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_046.wav|It is all about the story.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_047.wav|The whole thing is the music.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_048.wav|In fact, they are the future of investment.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_049.wav|That is still the case.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_050.wav|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_051.wav|In my view, it has to be done.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_052.wav|The pressure on the players will build.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_053.wav|Their campaign is in disarray.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_054.wav|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.|17,,
wav48/p244/p244_055.wav|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_056.wav|It has been a horrible, horrible time.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_057.wav|Clearly, they had other problems.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_058.wav|This trend is likely to strengthen.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_059.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.|17,,
wav48/p244/p244_060.wav|We have got to deliver.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_061.wav|That was the difference today.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_062.wav|The company continues to grow.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_063.wav|He said it was for sale.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_064.wav|We felt it was sufficient.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_065.wav|That is all in the past.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_066.wav|There is a lot to be done.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_067.wav|But that's another story for another day.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_068.wav|He has not been dropped.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_069.wav|It was an outstanding performance.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_070.wav|I can't remember a lot about the accident.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_071.wav|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.|17,,
wav48/p244/p244_072.wav|It is only the beginning.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_073.wav|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_074.wav|Only water is currently allowed.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_075.wav|This time, it might be for real.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_076.wav|She did that for the rest of her life.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_077.wav|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_078.wav|That will be the office.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_079.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_080.wav|How are you, sir ?|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_081.wav|So is that it, then ?|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_082.wav|Do I have a favourite ?|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_083.wav|What do we do ?|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_084.wav|Why do it otherwise ?|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_085.wav|It starts with the script.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_086.wav|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.|17,,
wav48/p244/p244_087.wav|It would have been around the turn of the century.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_088.wav|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.|17,,
wav48/p244/p244_089.wav|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_090.wav|It seems a good thing to try.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_091.wav|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_092.wav|It sounds a lot of money.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_093.wav|However, a ruling will not come before next week.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_094.wav|It is not a story.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_095.wav|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_096.wav|He is in the US.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_097.wav|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_098.wav|It took an option on the process.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_099.wav|By then, he was walking on water.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_100.wav|This is a game of confidence.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_101.wav|On Saturday, it was much the same.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_102.wav|He liked the weather, the courses, the food.|17,,
wav48/p244/p244_103.wav|The door is still open, but we need a bit of help.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_104.wav|The trick is to try it.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_105.wav|I had no intention of misleading anyone.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_106.wav|Victory was never in doubt.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_107.wav|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_108.wav|On this occasion, the case for a public inquiry was not made.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_109.wav|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.|17,,
wav48/p244/p244_110.wav|Then again, we could have.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_111.wav|There, you were just a body.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_112.wav|But he has not become a monster.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_113.wav|He is not a dancer.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_114.wav|We had planned to sell the property for some time.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_115.wav|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_116.wav|In the end we have to take a stand.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_117.wav|This is a sea change in approach.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_118.wav|Otherwise, the market may come back.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_119.wav|The procedures were not in place.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_120.wav|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_121.wav|In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_122.wav|He was not alone at the top of the board.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_123.wav|The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_124.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_125.wav|We had a great time.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_126.wav|I am delighted to have been the captain of the winning side.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_127.wav|According to criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_128.wav|It was far from business as usual.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_129.wav|He wanted to record the group.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_130.wav|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_131.wav|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_132.wav|It is hard to believe.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_133.wav|Or it would have been.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_134.wav|Three days later, he was killed.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_135.wav|Football is a passion for many.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_136.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_137.wav|So, did she meet him ?|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_138.wav|So what is the campaign about ?|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_139.wav|And does it ?|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_140.wav|Are you from the rugby ?|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_141.wav|However, the bank denied that he was in the running.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_142.wav|That was the first step.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_143.wav|However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_144.wav|I have been in contact with him.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_145.wav|Actors like to be in the centre.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_146.wav|When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_147.wav|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_148.wav|I am the manager of Scotland.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_149.wav|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.|17,,
wav48/p244/p244_150.wav|There were no grounds for his action.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_151.wav|I can't even get into the A team.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_152.wav|It starts at the top.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_153.wav|Others are expected to follow the lead.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_154.wav|She does not want to speak.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_155.wav|It was all for good reason as well.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_156.wav|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_157.wav|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_158.wav|As for the warning, it was not needed.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_159.wav|If not, a deal could take many months.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_160.wav|We want to get there.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_161.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_162.wav|There is a lack of staff.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_163.wav|Not that the occasion was without restraint.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_164.wav|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_165.wav|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_166.wav|At last, in the third year, a letter has arrived.|17,,
wav48/p244/p244_167.wav|Full consent is expected by the end of next year.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_168.wav|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.|17,,
wav48/p244/p244_169.wav|Anyone can do the sums.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_170.wav|We have to create it in the playing strength of the team.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_171.wav|It is not about the money, it is about everything.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_172.wav|Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_173.wav|We were all over the place in the first half.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_174.wav|Like the others, he was arrested.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_175.wav|All the pressure was on him.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_176.wav|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_177.wav|They have not been named.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_178.wav|It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_179.wav|I think the Labour party is completely split on this.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_180.wav|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_181.wav|I was always in control.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_182.wav|It was by the numbers.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_183.wav|I would like to see the figures for the second quarter.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_184.wav|It should never have happened.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_185.wav|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_186.wav|The feeling is hard to describe.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_187.wav|It is difficult to say.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_188.wav|That is a question for the next manager.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_189.wav|By then, however, both men were already in the US.|17,,
wav48/p244/p244_190.wav|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_191.wav|It is simply not true.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_192.wav|Are you going to win ?|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_193.wav|Was it the wife ?|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_194.wav|Why change it ?|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_195.wav|What do we want to do that for ?|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_196.wav|Does the name matter ?|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_197.wav|That you can do it.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_198.wav|I would like to continue to develop.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_199.wav|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_200.wav|He has defended the system.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_201.wav|We want to begin a programme in the UK.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_203.wav|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_204.wav|It is not an issue.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_205.wav|They have to get that sorted.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_206.wav|We can take the city.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_207.wav|He played it like a veteran.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_208.wav|It was the story of the second half.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_209.wav|Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_210.wav|As many as the market will support.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_211.wav|He is believed to live in Britain.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_212.wav|Hopefully, it will bring new customers.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_213.wav|The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_214.wav|This conference was never confirmed.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_215.wav|A team is a team.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_216.wav|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_217.wav|I'm interested in interesting work.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_218.wav|It decided to blame the media.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_219.wav|THE force is with them.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_220.wav|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_221.wav|It was important to win today.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_222.wav|He was not injured in the attack.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_223.wav|Because he was born in England.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_224.wav|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_225.wav|Milk producers were in need of immediate assistance, he said.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_226.wav|I was not overly concerned about this.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_227.wav|However, it is not as simple as this.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_228.wav|We want this place to work.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_229.wav|It still has an effect.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_230.wav|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_231.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.|17,,
wav48/p244/p244_232.wav|Other villages were completely deserted.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_233.wav|There is a lot of concern.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_234.wav|It will be decided in the next month.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_235.wav|We have to win the group.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_236.wav|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_237.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_238.wav|We have an election in eight days.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_239.wav|There was a lot of resentment.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_240.wav|This is a fight to the death.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_241.wav|All will be revealed in due course.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_242.wav|He is a man of the people.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_243.wav|The matter is under appeal.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_244.wav|And they were being paid ?|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_245.wav|was everything done to save people ?|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_246.wav|What was the matter for concern ?|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_247.wav|Do I think about them often ?|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_248.wav|Is it in the right place ?|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_249.wav|Did he trip ?|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_250.wav|Sadly, it could not be done.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_251.wav|I wouldn't even respond to that question.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_252.wav|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_253.wav|Instead, he missed the lot.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_254.wav|I was never in danger.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_255.wav|A lot has been written.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_256.wav|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_257.wav|It was really good in the first week.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_258.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_259.wav|However, the ball refused to sit for the Frenchman.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_260.wav|That is not the case in Europe.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_261.wav|But it was a loss.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_262.wav|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_263.wav|The performance continues to improve.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_264.wav|It expected this trend to continue.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_265.wav|However, no further action was taken by police.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_266.wav|It depends on Labour, not on us.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_267.wav|But we were in control at that point.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_268.wav|It has to be enforced.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_269.wav|The party has never fully recovered.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_270.wav|Moreover, it must be for all sports.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_271.wav|But the government has so far failed to listen.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_272.wav|He must have a crack at it.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_273.wav|I am still waiting for a reply.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_274.wav|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_275.wav|He was good, but not that good.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_276.wav|The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_277.wav|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_278.wav|However, the matter is not going to end there.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_279.wav|It might be sad, but it's a fact.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_280.wav|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_281.wav|Obviously, we would want to look at this.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_282.wav|On a practical level, it would be difficult.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_283.wav|If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_284.wav|It is important that he is involved.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_285.wav|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_286.wav|It should be noted that he has been released without charge.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_287.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_288.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.|17,,
wav48/p244/p244_290.wav|I should think so, too.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_291.wav|None of the agencies was able to help.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_292.wav|I didn't see the point.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_293.wav|This idea has been around for four years.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_294.wav|We are in a war.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_295.wav|Do you think we are a top nation ?|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_296.wav|Is our children learning ?|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_297.wav|How independent is that ?|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_298.wav|What form did that take ?|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_299.wav|Are they free ?|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_300.wav|Scotland won by six wickets.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_301.wav|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_302.wav|This is a historic agreement.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_303.wav|We have to be realistic.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_304.wav|Every one is a winner.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_305.wav|There was a hole in it.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_306.wav|It will be done in stages.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_307.wav|It all started with a visiting rugby club.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_308.wav|Every character was completely different.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_309.wav|But it is a similar problem.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_310.wav|In the UK, inflation data will be published this morning.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_311.wav|But it is important for a number of reasons.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_312.wav|In that moment, I was happy.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_313.wav|All of the management has invested in the firm.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_314.wav|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_315.wav|They were not at the property yesterday.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_316.wav|It involved the same people.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_317.wav|We want to get back into the Champions League.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_318.wav|We have to be very, very careful.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_319.wav|Look at the potential of this club.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_320.wav|Hopefully, this week will be good.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_321.wav|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.|17,,
wav48/p244/p244_322.wav|We did something about it.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_323.wav|But it is up again.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_324.wav|However, the devil is in the detail.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_325.wav|For the moment, however, the position is clear.|17,,
wav48/p244/p244_326.wav|The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_327.wav|He is already in place.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_328.wav|Another difference is the cost.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_329.wav|Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_330.wav|And we can do it.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_331.wav|What are they for ?|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_333.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_334.wav|Tax is a matter for national governments.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_335.wav|And it's a goodbye from him.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_336.wav|It is a sensitive issue.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_337.wav|They have to be addressed.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_338.wav|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_339.wav|Like many companies, it is a problem.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_340.wav|The business is mainly active in Europe, the US and Australia.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_341.wav|However, a bid was never made.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_342.wav|That is the lesson of the last three weeks.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_343.wav|Something is going to have to give.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_344.wav|And the context is also completely different.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_345.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_346.wav|The banking sector was weak.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_347.wav|But the New Year was special.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_348.wav|We never played at all.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_349.wav|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.|17,,
wav48/p244/p244_350.wav|This isn't the end of story.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_351.wav|He is a great prospect.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_352.wav|He has been told by the doctor to rest.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_353.wav|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_354.wav|Of course, it does not have to be this way.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_355.wav|This latter suggestion is very important.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_356.wav|However, it does not tell the full story.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_357.wav|They were impressive against France.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_358.wav|The challenge is to win a cup.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_359.wav|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_360.wav|It was a test in itself.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_361.wav|Either team will be hard.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_362.wav|The parents will have a great time, too.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_363.wav|At first, the youngster was not keen.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_364.wav|However, it has to be seen as part of a package.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_365.wav|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_366.wav|In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_367.wav|Lately, that market has come under pressure.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_368.wav|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_369.wav|However, it was well worth the wait.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_370.wav|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_371.wav|I have a good feeling about this.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_372.wav|The news is not all bad.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_373.wav|Some of the passing was a disgrace.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_374.wav|However, it does not seem to be the case.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_375.wav|It is almost certain to be the last.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_376.wav|You have to be patient.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_377.wav|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_378.wav|I was delighted to accept.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_379.wav|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_380.wav|We are not going to fight in Kosovo.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_381.wav|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_382.wav|It's fantastic to win again.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_383.wav|For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_384.wav|The company won the first round but lost on appeal.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_385.wav|Everything is in the mix.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_386.wav|An announcement is expected this week.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_387.wav|He will be difficult to replace.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_388.wav|I would be interested in another attempt.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_389.wav|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_390.wav|He was on a mission.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_391.wav|Does it matter ?|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_392.wav|How do you take them away ?|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_393.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?|17,,
wav48/p244/p244_394.wav|After the match, do you ?|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_395.wav|One-third of the places are already taken.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_396.wav|I understand the frustration of the fans.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_397.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_398.wav|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_399.wav|I want this one to be different.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_400.wav|It is the last meeting of the season.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_401.wav|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.|17,,
wav48/p244/p244_402.wav|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_403.wav|He is a quality player.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_404.wav|The service is expected to be introduced in December.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_405.wav|It's all been about the basics of the business.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_406.wav|There is a demand for it.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_407.wav|It's great that it happened in Britain.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_408.wav|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_409.wav|They are not going the length of the pitch.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_410.wav|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_411.wav|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_412.wav|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_413.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_414.wav|In order to get there, we have got to invest.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_415.wav|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_416.wav|There is no need to panic.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_417.wav|It had been on the cards.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_418.wav|However, he said the proposal was at an early stage.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_419.wav|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.|17,,
wav48/p244/p244_420.wav|That might mean another delay.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_421.wav|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.|17,,,
wav48/p244/p244_422.wav|I am delighted for them.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_423.wav|He's had to suffer for the last six years.|17,,,,
wav48/p244/p244_424.wav|But it was a struggle.|17,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_001.wav|Please call Stella. |18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |18,,
wav48/p245/p245_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |18,,
wav48/p245/p245_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |18,,
wav48/p245/p245_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_016.wav|Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |18,,
wav48/p245/p245_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|18,,
wav48/p245/p245_025.wav|Johnson was pretty low.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_026.wav|But it failed.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_027.wav|It's nice to hear.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_028.wav|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_029.wav|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_030.wav|They should be so lucky.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_031.wav|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|18,,
wav48/p245/p245_032.wav|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_033.wav|I was an athlete.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_034.wav|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_035.wav|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_036.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_037.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_038.wav|It has failed.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_039.wav|It was clear.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_040.wav|It's a great thing.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_041.wav|Indeed, he does.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_042.wav|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_043.wav|She is believed to be in South Africa.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_044.wav|But it took a lot of bottle.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_045.wav|Sure, it's funny.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_046.wav|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_047.wav|This represents a tough game for us.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_048.wav|We need to chat.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_049.wav|The boy is no longer with us.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_050.wav|Who can say?|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_051.wav|It's a blessing.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_053.wav|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_054.wav|They had to explain it.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_055.wav|He had no enemies.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_056.wav|Sadly, it can't.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_057.wav|None has ever been found.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_058.wav|It's a matter of balance.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_059.wav|There will be tough opponents to this report.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_060.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_061.wav|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_062.wav|He should have asked for a second opinion.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_063.wav|He was popular.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_064.wav|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_065.wav|The script was funny.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_066.wav|You need a trademark.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_067.wav|There is an element of racism in Scotland.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_068.wav|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_069.wav|She died in hospital two hours later.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_070.wav|Is there a new way forward?|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_071.wav|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_072.wav|People must remain vigilant.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_073.wav|This is the way things should be handled.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_074.wav|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_075.wav|What has changed?|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_076.wav|I'd like to continue that record.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_077.wav|That is bound to happen.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_078.wav|He seems to be pleased with the picture.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_079.wav|We have other options.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_080.wav|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_081.wav|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_082.wav|It's never too late.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_083.wav|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_084.wav|Now the system is right behind us.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_085.wav|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_086.wav|It is a lifeline.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_087.wav|The reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_088.wav|Then came the crunch.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_089.wav|If you could find it.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_090.wav|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_091.wav|They were outside the circle.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_092.wav|He's a star.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_093.wav|It was some time before she found out he was safe.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_094.wav|We want to get to the final, anyway.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_095.wav|Oil embargo endorsed.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_096.wav|No date has been set for the appeal.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_097.wav|It was an adventure.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_098.wav|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.|18,,
wav48/p245/p245_099.wav|They had to be cut from the wreckage.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_100.wav|I was angry.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_101.wav|That team is due to be announced this morning.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_102.wav|I have had no social life at all.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_103.wav|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_104.wav|I'm delighted about that.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_105.wav|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_106.wav|Who would be a referee?|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_107.wav|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.|18,,
wav48/p245/p245_108.wav|Who would have?|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_109.wav|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_110.wav|We work on the same level.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_111.wav|I can't even get into the A team.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_112.wav|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_113.wav|Next season for every manager is a long time away.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_114.wav|They keep the atmosphere in mind.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_115.wav|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_116.wav|I do not think this family will ever get over this.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_117.wav|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_118.wav|He has been under great pressure.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_119.wav|Who will attend?|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_120.wav|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_121.wav|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_122.wav|What will happen then?|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_123.wav|Is that it?|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_124.wav|He was in a great deal of pain.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_125.wav|We want to keep the pound.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_126.wav|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_127.wav|There is a lack of chemistry.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_128.wav|I was awful.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_129.wav|That group reported just before Christmas.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_130.wav|It is not just about pay.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_131.wav|He will emerge as a world leader.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_132.wav|They did very well.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_133.wav|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_134.wav|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_135.wav|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_136.wav|It was deployed in the Gulf War.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_137.wav|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_138.wav|Mr Blair had done well.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_139.wav|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_140.wav|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_141.wav|He can do no wrong.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_142.wav|Was this element always there?|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_143.wav|I've learned from my mistakes.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_144.wav|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_145.wav|It has to be now.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_146.wav|I was in the train station overnight.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_147.wav|The release attracted little attention.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_148.wav|That will do for me.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_149.wav|Nobody did in those days.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_150.wav|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_151.wav|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_152.wav|It became a book by itself.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_154.wav|We wanted it left for a wee while.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_155.wav|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_156.wav|The hotel was now for sale.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_157.wav|I drove the ball well.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_158.wav|Everyone can be bought.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_160.wav|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_161.wav|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_162.wav|They will run a mile.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_163.wav|We did everything by the book.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_164.wav|It is not fair.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_165.wav|What has caused the demise of singing?|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_166.wav|I had a train to catch.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_167.wav|It was an odd affair, in many respects.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_168.wav|It is tough, but possible.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_170.wav|The procedure is the same in all cases.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_171.wav|People will ask about us.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_172.wav|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_173.wav|We must keep our feet on the ground.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_174.wav|However, he said the money had not been wasted.|18,,,

wav48/p245/p245_180.wav|Is that success?|18,,,,

wav48/p245/p245_189.wav|That will be vital.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_190.wav|Now, it's all right.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_191.wav|It's like a garage.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_192.wav|We don't even know his name.|18,,,,

wav48/p245/p245_221.wav|We are in the hat.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_222.wav|We were a load of rubbish.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_223.wav|They should come forward.|18,,,,

wav48/p245/p245_244.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_245.wav|This year I understood.|18,,,,

wav48/p245/p245_252.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_253.wav|It's that kind of place.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_254.wav|they fail to engage.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_256.wav|I was happily surprised.|18,,,,

wav48/p245/p245_276.wav|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_277.wav|It was a virus.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_278.wav|Yet, it worked.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_279.wav|It's very safe.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_280.wav|Well, he can do it.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_281.wav|He was obviously very genuine.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_282.wav|It goes back a long way.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_283.wav|The weather forecast isn't good.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_284.wav|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_285.wav|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_286.wav|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_287.wav|That could change.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_288.wav|The goals will come.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_289.wav|Sunday's game was not a trial.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_290.wav|This is a huge confidence boost.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_291.wav|We have to sort it out ourselves.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_292.wav|He has retired.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_293.wav|There was no hint of scandal.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_294.wav|I thought it was my only chance.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_295.wav|Nothing is safe.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_296.wav|They are wrong.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_297.wav|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_298.wav|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_299.wav|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_300.wav|It's just not funny!|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_301.wav|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_302.wav|And he goes with it.|18,,,,

wav48/p245/p245_304.wav|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_305.wav|We want to play at the worlds.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_306.wav|We have waited a long time for this.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_307.wav|He was solid.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_308.wav|This is the culture change in medicine.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_309.wav|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_310.wav|It also provides a wealth of contrast within the movement.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_311.wav|I never thought it would take this long.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_312.wav|They wanted the club to make money.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_313.wav|Craig is a major concern for us.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_314.wav|For the moment, our position remains the same.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_315.wav|They had a confession.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_316.wav|I am very happy to be here.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_317.wav|We think all other measures are not exhausted.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_318.wav|There was no time scale.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_319.wav|My view has now completely changed.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_320.wav|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_321.wav|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_322.wav|The boat was fantastic.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_323.wav|I saw some good things.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_324.wav|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_325.wav|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_326.wav|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_327.wav|Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_328.wav|The same things will happen with GM foods.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_329.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_330.wav|Who will do it?|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_331.wav|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_332.wav|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_333.wav|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_334.wav|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_335.wav|The train was on time.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_336.wav|Action is needed now.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_337.wav|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_338.wav|Indeed, it was magical.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_339.wav|I would miss him.|18,,,,

wav48/p245/p245_344.wav|Chambers said he would accept the place.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_345.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_346.wav|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_347.wav|Like his acting, it was an accident.|18,,,
wav48/p245/p245_348.wav|They should take their mobile phones.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_349.wav|It is not like working for a living.|18,,,,

wav48/p245/p245_355.wav|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.|18,,,,
wav48/p245/p245_356.wav|It's not that clear-cut.|18,,,,

wav48/p245/p245_358.wav|He's very explosive.|18,,,,

wav48/p246/p246_001.wav|Please call Stella. |19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |19,,
wav48/p246/p246_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |19,,
wav48/p246/p246_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |19,,
wav48/p246/p246_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by raindrops which causes the rainbows. |19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |19,,
wav48/p246/p246_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|19,,
wav48/p246/p246_025.wav|He has not been named.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_026.wav|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_027.wav|Is this accurate?|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_028.wav|However, the following year the cancer returned.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_029.wav|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_030.wav|There's a story, too.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_031.wav|This is the window.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_032.wav|He was jailed for five years.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_033.wav|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_034.wav|Then, suddenly, they weren't.|19,,
wav48/p246/p246_035.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_036.wav|It has failed.|19,,,,

wav48/p246/p246_038.wav|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.|19,,
wav48/p246/p246_039.wav|Indeed, he does.|19,,,

wav48/p246/p246_041.wav|The ambition this year is to improve on last.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_042.wav|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_043.wav|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_044.wav|We will push.|19,,,,

wav48/p246/p246_051.wav|Every aspect of our play was first class.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_052.wav|Here's a clue.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_053.wav|Her body was found about four miles from the car.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_054.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.|19,,
wav48/p246/p246_055.wav|It is unique.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_056.wav|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_057.wav|That's the truth.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_058.wav|I feel I did not have enough time.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_059.wav|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_060.wav|Scotland had great assets.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_061.wav|It's that kind of place.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_062.wav|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_063.wav|He could make it.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_064.wav|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_065.wav|Robin Williams is very subdued.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_066.wav|The tournament has now been cancelled.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_067.wav|There could be a way back.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_068.wav|Then followed a bout of flu.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_069.wav|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.|19,,
wav48/p246/p246_070.wav|It is a job creation scheme.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_071.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_072.wav|Even the one she loved.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_073.wav|People must remain vigilant.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_074.wav|Today she has been released.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_075.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_076.wav|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_077.wav|He is in the queue.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_078.wav|I first met him last summer.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_079.wav|He seems to be pleased with the picture.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_080.wav|A play is a set of actions.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_081.wav|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_082.wav|It is a blow.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_083.wav|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_084.wav|They lived for their children.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_085.wav|It will be tight.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_086.wav|The city council is a major property owner in the area.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_087.wav|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_088.wav|Tony Blair said as little.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_089.wav|As, indeed, they would be.|19,,
wav48/p246/p246_090.wav|This one did.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_091.wav|It was clear.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_092.wav|But I was wrong.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_093.wav|It is home-grown.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_094.wav|I saw the whole thing.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_095.wav|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_096.wav|However, we have not come to any conclusions.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_097.wav|They make a selective perception process.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_098.wav|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_099.wav|No, the equipment is extra.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_100.wav|That would be unlawful.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_101.wav|Oil embargo endorsed.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_102.wav|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_103.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_104.wav|It was an adventure.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_105.wav|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_106.wav|I was fighting for my life, I thought.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_107.wav|Is that right?|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_108.wav|I had some time with Aston Villa.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_109.wav|It was the eighties.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_110.wav|It is so sad.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_111.wav|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_112.wav|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_113.wav|Who would be a referee?|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_114.wav|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_115.wav|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.|19,,
wav48/p246/p246_116.wav|Who would have?|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_117.wav|Here, again, they were denied a voice.|19,,
wav48/p246/p246_118.wav|There were no grounds for his action.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_119.wav|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_120.wav|She really suffered for her art.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_121.wav|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_122.wav|It is not a U-turn.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_123.wav|I just wanted a break.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_124.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_125.wav|I am now unemployed.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_126.wav|She said she would not welcome the flowers.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_127.wav|It plans to return to this field.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_128.wav|It's perfectly feasible.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_129.wav|We work well together.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_130.wav|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_131.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_132.wav|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_133.wav|My daughter is an adult.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_134.wav|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_135.wav|It seems so long since I did the exams.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_136.wav|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_137.wav|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_138.wav|No-one in Downing Street can speak the language of the unions.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_139.wav|She died at her home.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_140.wav|He realises his mistake.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_141.wav|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_142.wav|I was awful.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_143.wav|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_144.wav|Washington is consumed by the crisis.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_145.wav|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_146.wav|It is not just about pay.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_147.wav|I am just trying to do my job.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_148.wav|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_149.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_150.wav|I was stunned.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_151.wav|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_152.wav|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_153.wav|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_154.wav|She had gone to the Catholic school.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_155.wav|We are on a four-year mission.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_156.wav|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_157.wav|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.|19,,
wav48/p246/p246_158.wav|I'd love to be like Peter.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_159.wav|I will tell you.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_160.wav|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_161.wav|It is not like us.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_162.wav|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.|19,,
wav48/p246/p246_163.wav|We have a budget in March.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_164.wav|Again, we were lucky.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_165.wav|We should do everything at a stroke.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_166.wav|You had to go and see him.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_167.wav|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_168.wav|He was a crazy man.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_169.wav|As we worked.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_170.wav|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_171.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_172.wav|If that's the case, he will struggle.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_173.wav|I drove the ball well.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_174.wav|Tony had arrived.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_175.wav|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_176.wav|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_177.wav|The goals were good.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_178.wav|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_179.wav|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.|19,,
wav48/p246/p246_180.wav|They need to look after themselves.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_181.wav|It's to do with context.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_182.wav|Does this matter?|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_183.wav|One was a lawyer.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_184.wav|There is no openness.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_185.wav|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_186.wav|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_187.wav|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.|19,,
wav48/p246/p246_188.wav|It was very frightened and dirty.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_189.wav|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_190.wav|The concerns are the same.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_191.wav|Is that success?|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_192.wav|I do not own the vessel in question.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_193.wav|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_194.wav|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_195.wav|Who will pay for this?|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_196.wav|They've got three-quarters of the way.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_197.wav|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_198.wav|It's all about money, money, money.|19,,
wav48/p246/p246_199.wav|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_200.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_201.wav|I will win.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_202.wav|Feel the heat?|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_203.wav|He knows a lot.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_204.wav|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.|19,,
wav48/p246/p246_205.wav|It had all been arranged.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_206.wav|I have decided to quit the show.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_207.wav|My neighbours are horrified.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_208.wav|It's not ideal.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_209.wav|In each case they were a goal down.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_210.wav|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_211.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_212.wav|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_213.wav|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_214.wav|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_215.wav|The report is due out next month.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_216.wav|Because they didn't want to know.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_217.wav|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_218.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_219.wav|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_220.wav|It's a question of creating a future awareness.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_221.wav|I'd never seen a play about me.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_222.wav|It's not before time.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_223.wav|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_224.wav|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_225.wav|But she was.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_226.wav|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.|19,,
wav48/p246/p246_227.wav|At the time, he was a living legend.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_228.wav|My wife and family are the support system.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_229.wav|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_230.wav|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_231.wav|But you think I'm going to argue with the big man?|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_232.wav|Of course I was tempted.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_233.wav|Well, they were the unlucky ones.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_234.wav|You should be.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_235.wav|It's quite nice.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_236.wav|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_237.wav|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_238.wav|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_239.wav|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_240.wav|It is hard won.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_241.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_242.wav|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_243.wav|The scene is about this?|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_244.wav|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_245.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_246.wav|I should think so, too.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_247.wav|It was a hit.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_248.wav|There's the mix.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_249.wav|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_250.wav|Is there on his hands?|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_251.wav|I can't get a job.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_252.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_253.wav|they fail to engage.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_254.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_255.wav|Is that a serious question?|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_256.wav|They must play for each other.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_257.wav|I could have got out a long time ago.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_258.wav|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_259.wav|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_260.wav|There's not much money in cycling.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_261.wav|Souter will be back.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_262.wav|Blood samples were taken.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_263.wav|They want to shut the Scottish Office.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_264.wav|It will be done in stages.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_265.wav|There is no link.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_266.wav|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_267.wav|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_268.wav|We are happy.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_270.wav|We're in shock.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_271.wav|Our objective is to tackle poverty.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_272.wav|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.|19,,
wav48/p246/p246_273.wav|It's a way of life.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_274.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_275.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_276.wav|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_277.wav|They seem to get away with it.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_278.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_279.wav|It is so very obvious.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_280.wav|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_281.wav|It's so awful.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_282.wav|If not, he should go home.|19,,,
wav48/p246/p246_283.wav|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_284.wav|We are a grandmother.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_285.wav|But I've won both ways.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_286.wav|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_287.wav|You feel very helpless.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_288.wav|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.|19,,
wav48/p246/p246_289.wav|Dialogue is the key.|19,,,,
wav48/p246/p246_290.wav|He will address the nation this evening.|19,,,,

wav48/p247/p247_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. )|20,,,
wav48/p247/p247_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. )|20,,,,

wav48/p247/p247_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. )|20,,,

wav48/p248/p248_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |21,,
wav48/p248/p248_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |21,,
wav48/p248/p248_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |21,,
wav48/p248/p248_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |21,,
wav48/p248/p248_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|21,,
wav48/p248/p248_025.wav|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_026.wav|It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_027.wav|But it failed.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_028.wav|That's no bad thing.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_029.wav|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_030.wav|I have a theory.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_031.wav|Because it's a waste of time for both sides.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_032.wav|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_033.wav|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_034.wav|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_035.wav|I expected these kind of questions.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_036.wav|It's a matter of balance.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_037.wav|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_038.wav|But it may take some time to confirm the findings.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_039.wav|It was clear.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_040.wav|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_041.wav|She is believed to be in South Africa.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_042.wav|I was scared.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_043.wav|It was ugly.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_044.wav|That is a break with tradition.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_045.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_046.wav|No meaningful response was issued.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_047.wav|It is urgent.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_048.wav|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_049.wav|The record companies have gone through the floor.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_050.wav|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.|21,,,,

wav48/p248/p248_053.wav|He looks like an Afghan.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_054.wav|They had to explain it.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_055.wav|Here's a clue.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_056.wav|But the law is very clear on this.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_057.wav|Next league matches Celtic.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_058.wav|It's very odd.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_059.wav|It will take time.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_060.wav|The problems are a result of that shortfall.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_061.wav|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_062.wav|Four other charges were dropped.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_063.wav|It is not great art.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_064.wav|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_065.wav|Scotland had great assets.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_066.wav|There will be tough opponents to this report.|21,,,,

wav48/p248/p248_071.wav|There was an e-mail.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_072.wav|Then followed a bout of flu.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_073.wav|Neither it is.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_074.wav|I had my suspicions.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_075.wav|He got the same story.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_076.wav|It works for us.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_077.wav|It is a time bomb.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_078.wav|Today she has been released.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_079.wav|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_080.wav|It may well have been.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_081.wav|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_082.wav|Nothing is yet confirmed.|21,,,,

wav48/p248/p248_091.wav|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_092.wav|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_093.wav|He was possessed|21,,,,

wav48/p248/p248_096.wav|It is a delight on every level.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_097.wav|I had a ball today.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_098.wav|Two of the team became ill.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_099.wav|That's all right then.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_100.wav|That would be unlawful.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_101.wav|That time is not now, however.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_102.wav|Oil embargo endorsed.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_103.wav|I didn't play well last year.|21,,,,

wav48/p248/p248_106.wav|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_107.wav|He pleaded for caution.|21,,,,

wav48/p248/p248_110.wav|It had been played at festivals.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_111.wav|We do not expect any surplus.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_112.wav|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_113.wav|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_114.wav|It's not a new concept in jazz.|21,,,,

wav48/p248/p248_116.wav|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_117.wav|Maybe this battle has been.|21,,,,

wav48/p248/p248_130.wav|I had relied on him.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_131.wav|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_132.wav|It's the big omission.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_133.wav|It plans to return to this field.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_134.wav|Our intentions are real.|21,,,,

wav48/p248/p248_139.wav|It was typical.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_140.wav|I was the last man to touch the ball.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_141.wav|He has the edge.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_142.wav|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_143.wav|It's a crucial award.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_144.wav|He is severe.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_145.wav|There is a lack of chemistry.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_146.wav|This film will be totally awesome.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_147.wav|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.|21,,,,

wav48/p248/p248_149.wav|Last month he made his debut in Japan.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_150.wav|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.|21,,,,

wav48/p248/p248_156.wav|That includes the equipment?|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_157.wav|They should stop the bombing.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_158.wav|That's the name of the game, though.|21,,,

wav48/p248/p248_161.wav|Eight months later, he was dead.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_162.wav|It has to be now.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_163.wav|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_164.wav|I was in the train station overnight.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_165.wav|We knew we had the goal we wanted.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_166.wav|It's that sort of night.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_167.wav|We have a budget in March.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_168.wav|By then, however, both men were already in the US.|21,,
wav48/p248/p248_169.wav|The post will be unpaid.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_170.wav|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_171.wav|Waiting times for these services are too long.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_172.wav|They thought they had found a home.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_173.wav|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_174.wav|The jury is still out.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_175.wav|Blair's response was weak.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_176.wav|IT S the real thing, for sure.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_177.wav|And I saw the light!|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_178.wav|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_179.wav|Tony had arrived.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_180.wav|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_181.wav|The goals were good.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_182.wav|I've been there.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_183.wav|Four policemen were wounded.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_184.wav|They receive a high profile in the media.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_185.wav|We did everything by the book.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_186.wav|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_187.wav|They need to look after themselves.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_188.wav|What has caused the demise of singing?|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_189.wav|You know the sort of thing.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_190.wav|I cannot say too much about them.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_191.wav|It was an odd affair, in many respects.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_192.wav|All options are open.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_193.wav|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_194.wav|However, this idea is never developed.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_195.wav|It wasn't to be.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_196.wav|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_197.wav|It's the same old story.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_198.wav|It was still there, but right at the end.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_199.wav|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_200.wav|The service from the other players was super.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_201.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_202.wav|But she might be.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_203.wav|It's just awful.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_204.wav|Today was first class.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_205.wav|It was worth a photograph.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_206.wav|We have an election in eight days.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_207.wav|Now, it's all right.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_208.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_209.wav|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_210.wav|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_211.wav|He is slightly confused.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_212.wav|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_213.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_214.wav|It had all been arranged.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_215.wav|In each case they were a goal down.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_216.wav|I've got to hold my own hands up for this one.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_217.wav|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_218.wav|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_219.wav|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_220.wav|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_221.wav|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_222.wav|A career as a doctor is on hold.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_223.wav|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_224.wav|It was good fun.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_225.wav|I have spoken to the skipper.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_226.wav|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_227.wav|The track is currently covered in snow.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_228.wav|But he failed to win the committee's support.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_229.wav|At the time, he was a living legend.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_230.wav|It's the same as Glasgow.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_231.wav|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_232.wav|Police later said the scheme would end in November.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_233.wav|It is set in Paris.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_234.wav|They should come forward.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_235.wav|I haven't made the donation yet.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_236.wav|It's very safe.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_237.wav|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_238.wav|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_239.wav|It is no surprise.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_240.wav|My future is in the marathon.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_241.wav|We have a free vote on these things in our party.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_242.wav|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_243.wav|She is well balanced.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_244.wav|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_245.wav|It is hard won.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_246.wav|The scene is about this?|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_247.wav|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_248.wav|It's a record label, not a form of music.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_249.wav|It was a cry for help.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_250.wav|It was a hit.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_251.wav|This year I understood.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_252.wav|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_253.wav|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_254.wav|We run within the law.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_255.wav|Kirkwood was arrested.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_256.wav|they fail to engage.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_257.wav|They are real.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_258.wav|They must play for each other.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_259.wav|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_260.wav|It is also very valuable.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_261.wav|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_262.wav|That is highly unfair.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_263.wav|He will emerge as a world leader.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_264.wav|They want to shut the Scottish Office.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_265.wav|This is a question of Islam.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_266.wav|Of course, that is not the whole story.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_267.wav|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_268.wav|I am totally horrified by the sentence.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_269.wav|Immediate action must be taken.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_270.wav|He is a young man with a new deal.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_271.wav|He was also married with two children.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_272.wav|He's been here on numerous occasions.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_273.wav|It's a way of life.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_274.wav|I feel pretty good.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_275.wav|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_276.wav|If not, he should go home.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_277.wav|He looked very sharp.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_278.wav|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.|21,,
wav48/p248/p248_279.wav|You've got to have both sides.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_280.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_281.wav|He will address the nation this evening.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_282.wav|It was a virus.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_283.wav|Maloney is an engaging talent.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_284.wav|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_285.wav|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_286.wav|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_287.wav|It is not normal practice.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_288.wav|The release attracted little attention.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_289.wav|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_290.wav|IT S all in the hair.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_291.wav|What has altered?|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_292.wav|I thought it was my only chance.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_293.wav|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_294.wav|Our task is to complete the picture.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_295.wav|Davis is very supportive, as a director.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_296.wav|We believe the world has too many refugees already.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_297.wav|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_298.wav|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_299.wav|SCOTLAND has shown the way.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_300.wav|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_301.wav|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.|21,,
wav48/p248/p248_302.wav|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_303.wav|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_304.wav|We have waited a long time for this.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_305.wav|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_306.wav|It's about my time as a guitarist.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_307.wav|It should be equal.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_308.wav|Craig is a major concern for us.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_309.wav|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_310.wav|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_311.wav|Other people had looked at it.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_312.wav|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_313.wav|Off with their heads.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_314.wav|The parents will have a great time, too.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_315.wav|Donald was his friend.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_316.wav|I think I was recorded with a video camera.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_317.wav|He was unable to come.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_318.wav|I saw some good things.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_319.wav|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_320.wav|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_321.wav|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_322.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_323.wav|Who will do it?|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_324.wav|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_325.wav|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_326.wav|This is the way things should be handled.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_327.wav|The train was on time.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_328.wav|You were very proud that day to be among their friends.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_329.wav|He has to learn.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_330.wav|Indeed, it was magical.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_331.wav|There's no place to hide.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_332.wav|It will be very, very tight.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_333.wav|I said that I had been raped.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_334.wav|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_335.wav|The composer will conduct.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_336.wav|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_337.wav|Like his acting, it was an accident.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_338.wav|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_339.wav|It's the last thing on my mind.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_340.wav|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_341.wav|I'd like to take the plunge.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_342.wav|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_343.wav|It is horrible.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_344.wav|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_345.wav|I kept going for her.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_346.wav|Tyson is overwhelmed.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_347.wav|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_348.wav|But nothing happened.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_349.wav|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_350.wav|No other job in world football can compare to this one.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_351.wav|He seems to be pleased with the picture.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_352.wav|He has seen the past.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_353.wav|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_354.wav|It was that bad, that low.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_355.wav|That would help.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_356.wav|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_357.wav|Who was the mystery MP?|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_358.wav|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_359.wav|He later became a respected High Court judge.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_360.wav|He could face a jail sentence.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_361.wav|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_362.wav|Now, though, he has an incentive.|21,,
wav48/p248/p248_363.wav|They have not done so this season so far.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_364.wav|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_365.wav|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_366.wav|It is legally binding.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_367.wav|Well, the big day has arrived.|21,,,
wav48/p248/p248_368.wav|Five members were disciplined.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_369.wav|There is no signature.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_370.wav|I am a wealthy person.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_371.wav|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_372.wav|Colour was at the core of his life.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_373.wav|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.|21,,
wav48/p248/p248_374.wav|He's a lovely young man.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_375.wav|The casualties were not named.|21,,,,
wav48/p248/p248_376.wav|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.|21,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |22,,
wav48/p249/p249_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |22,,
wav48/p249/p249_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |22,,
wav48/p249/p249_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |22,,
wav48/p249/p249_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|22,,
wav48/p249/p249_025.wav|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_026.wav|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_027.wav|It's nice to hear.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_028.wav|They should be so lucky.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_029.wav|Because we do not need it.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_030.wav|There's a story, too.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_031.wav|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_032.wav|He took me on a tour of the wards.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_033.wav|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_034.wav|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_035.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_036.wav|It was clear.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_037.wav|It is not for any other purpose.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_038.wav|He did not know his daughter.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_039.wav|She is believed to be in South Africa.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_040.wav|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_041.wav|Sure, it's funny.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_042.wav|It's a crucial award.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_043.wav|The boy is no longer with us.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_044.wav|It's a blessing.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_045.wav|Is a drug dealer?|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_046.wav|As she explains.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_047.wav|He is too weak to move.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_048.wav|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_049.wav|I would love to have him home.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_050.wav|He looks like an Afghan.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_051.wav|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_052.wav|It will come all right.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_053.wav|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_054.wav|Next league matches Celtic.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_055.wav|It happens from time to time.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_056.wav|It's very odd.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_057.wav|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_058.wav|It is unique.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_059.wav|It will take time.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_060.wav|That's the truth.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_061.wav|Jobs could go.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_062.wav|The problems are a result of that shortfall.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_063.wav|I'm just enjoying every match.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_064.wav|And a film maker was born.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_065.wav|You did not change overnight.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_066.wav|There was a battle there.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_067.wav|Scotland had great assets.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_068.wav|I've spent a lot of time on buses.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_069.wav|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_070.wav|Have a look at our accounts.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_071.wav|It is like a river running by my home.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_072.wav|Try to save us.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_073.wav|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_074.wav|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_075.wav|Painful, but only because it's true.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_076.wav|The play is based on a real-life event.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_077.wav|It's very difficult to find a buyer.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_078.wav|He highlighted a lack of staff.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_079.wav|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_080.wav|Both sides have been hit by injury.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_081.wav|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_082.wav|It is a job creation scheme.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_083.wav|Even the one she loved.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_084.wav|I've not thought about it.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_086.wav|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_087.wav|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_088.wav|She had kept the news from him.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_089.wav|He seems to be pleased with the picture.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_090.wav|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_092.wav|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_093.wav|And rugby fans can help.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_094.wav|They lived for their children.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_095.wav|The city council is a major property owner in the area.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_096.wav|Now the system is right behind us.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_097.wav|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_098.wav|Today I couldn't run on it.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_099.wav|However, it did not end that way.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_100.wav|We must look forward.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_101.wav|It is an old family habit.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_102.wav|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_103.wav|Until you hit the big games.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_104.wav|Then came the crunch.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_105.wav|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_106.wav|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_107.wav|He is hungry for success and I am the same.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_108.wav|The court heard he drove into the path of a car.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_109.wav|It is a good day for the coalition.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_110.wav|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_111.wav|We want to get to the final, anyway.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_112.wav|It is a good lifestyle.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_113.wav|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_114.wav|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_115.wav|You had better believe it.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_116.wav|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_117.wav|It's a long process.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_118.wav|They were behind the wheel.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_119.wav|It was ugly.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_120.wav|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_121.wav|This is the end of a chapter, and it is very sad.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_122.wav|Does this mean.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_123.wav|They've got to account for it.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_124.wav|Who would have?|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_125.wav|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_126.wav|You can spend money on housing.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_127.wav|There were no grounds for his action.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_128.wav|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_129.wav|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_130.wav|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of a nation.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_131.wav|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_132.wav|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_133.wav|She said she could not believe that they had run away.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_134.wav|We're hopefully going to act as a catalyst for that.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_135.wav|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.|22,,
wav48/p249/p249_136.wav|What will happen then?|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_137.wav|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_138.wav|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_139.wav|It was very frightened and dirty.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_140.wav|I was the last man to touch the ball.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_141.wav|It's a question of fashion.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_142.wav|We need to chat.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_143.wav|Wallace was a prisoner of war.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_144.wav|He is severe.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_145.wav|It is difficult for Ali.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_146.wav|Is that Titanic?|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_147.wav|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.|22,,
wav48/p249/p249_148.wav|The idea is simple.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_149.wav|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_150.wav|It is like a football team.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_152.wav|It is not just about pay.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_153.wav|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_154.wav|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_155.wav|The weaknesses are few.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_156.wav|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_157.wav|It is not normal practice.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_159.wav|It was by the numbers.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_160.wav|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.|22,,
wav48/p249/p249_161.wav|There's a pause.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_162.wav|Neither side can win this war.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_163.wav|They should stop the bombing.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_164.wav|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_165.wav|These days are long gone.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_166.wav|It is an attitude of mind.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_167.wav|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_168.wav|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_169.wav|They say that vital evidence was not heard in the court.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_170.wav|I'm so worried about the roads.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_171.wav|We have to move forward.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_172.wav|Tell it like it was?|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_173.wav|It is not too late to get on board.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_174.wav|We have a budget in March.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_176.wav|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_177.wav|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_178.wav|The release attracted little attention.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_179.wav|Someone who cares|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_180.wav|I always felt they played for me.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_181.wav|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_182.wav|The jury is still out.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_183.wav|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_184.wav|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_185.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_186.wav|It should be easy.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_187.wav|Everyone can be bought.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_188.wav|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_189.wav|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_190.wav|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_191.wav|It is not fair.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_192.wav|Miller was every bit as happy.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_193.wav|We want to help them through it.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_194.wav|I put the drawing down.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_196.wav|I had a train to catch.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_197.wav|It is tough, but possible.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_198.wav|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_199.wav|However, this idea is never developed.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_200.wav|Last night was a key episode.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_201.wav|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_202.wav|It is a case of taking a risk.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_203.wav|I wanted to put myself on the line.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_204.wav|Sir Paul McCartney said he had been shocked by the attack.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_205.wav|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_206.wav|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_207.wav|The service from the other players was super.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_208.wav|He has a lot of experience as a captain in his career.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_209.wav|I have a cold.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_210.wav|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_211.wav|Ferguson should take note.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_212.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_213.wav|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_214.wav|It's all about money, money, money.|22,,
wav48/p249/p249_216.wav|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_217.wav|This is a good move for me.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_218.wav|But I am a worried man.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_219.wav|There was an e-mail.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_220.wav|Feel the heat?|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_221.wav|We'll have to work hard today.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_222.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_223.wav|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_224.wav|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_225.wav|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_226.wav|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_229.wav|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_230.wav|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_231.wav|It is a gamble.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_232.wav|My neighbours are horrified.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_234.wav|He is in the queue.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_235.wav|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_236.wav|Broke the birdie record.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_237.wav|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_238.wav|We were a load of rubbish.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_239.wav|Half of young people had had contact with the police.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_240.wav|It's a lovely, lovely film.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_241.wav|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_243.wav|The problem in Norway is outside the National.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_244.wav|We have a free vote on these things in our party.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_245.wav|We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_246.wav|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_247.wav|There wasn't a goal.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_248.wav|I was shocked.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_249.wav|I should think so, too.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_251.wav|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_252.wav|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.|22,,
wav48/p249/p249_253.wav|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_254.wav|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_255.wav|It is very important that we get the balance right.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_256.wav|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_257.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_258.wav|They must play for each other.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_259.wav|His contract was then not renewed.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_260.wav|He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_261.wav|That's the only thing I will say.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_262.wav|Blood samples were taken.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_263.wav|They are never here.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_265.wav|He has not created a Festival resource.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_266.wav|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_267.wav|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_268.wav|It is the same in Sweden.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_269.wav|And Michael was just great.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_270.wav|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_271.wav|It's not even finished.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_272.wav|Our objective is to tackle poverty.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_273.wav|Things can change.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_274.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_275.wav|People have no choice.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_276.wav|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_277.wav|He has a wealth of experience.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_278.wav|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_279.wav|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_280.wav|There's nothing I can say.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_281.wav|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_282.wav|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.|22,,
wav48/p249/p249_283.wav|You've got to have both sides.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_284.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_285.wav|Motherwell have no such good fortune.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_286.wav|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_287.wav|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_288.wav|Scotland were beaten again.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_289.wav|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_290.wav|I do not think this family will ever get over this.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_291.wav|These figures are truly awful.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_292.wav|He should have won.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_293.wav|Sunday's game was not a trial.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_294.wav|A new school will be built.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_295.wav|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_296.wav|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_297.wav|What has altered?|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_298.wav|However, the snow was welcomed by some.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_299.wav|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_300.wav|Our task is to complete the picture.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_301.wav|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_302.wav|They are wrong.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_303.wav|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_304.wav|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_305.wav|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_306.wav|They were on holiday in Egypt.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_307.wav|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_308.wav|And he goes with it.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_309.wav|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_310.wav|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.|22,,
wav48/p249/p249_311.wav|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_312.wav|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_313.wav|Is there on his hands?|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_314.wav|Special measures were needed.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_315.wav|They were fantastic.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_316.wav|In fact, they have the opposite effect.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_317.wav|They wanted the club to make money.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_318.wav|The problems began a long time ago.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_319.wav|Referees are easy targets.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_320.wav|Davis is very supportive, as a director.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_321.wav|I came into this world with nothing.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_322.wav|That's the law of the land.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_323.wav|There was no time scale.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_324.wav|I am so upset.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_326.wav|It could have gone either way.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_327.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_328.wav|My view has now completely changed.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_329.wav|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_330.wav|Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_331.wav|The same things will happen with GM foods.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_332.wav|Who will do it?|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_335.wav|I must make that clear.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_336.wav|The train was on time.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_337.wav|A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_338.wav|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_339.wav|That is the very reason why it was so vital.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_340.wav|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_341.wav|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_342.wav|He's a genius.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_343.wav|They should take their mobile phones.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_344.wav|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_345.wav|Eight months later, he was dead.|22,,,
wav48/p249/p249_347.wav|It's all going to clear the debt.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_348.wav|He had played well in that central role.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_349.wav|The decision is an absolute disgrace.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_350.wav|It is horrible.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_351.wav|It was very formal.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_352.wav|Both of those promises have already been honoured.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_353.wav|I kept going for her.|22,,,,
wav48/p249/p249_354.wav|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.|22,,,
wav48/p250/p250_001.wav|Please call Stella. |23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |23,,
wav48/p250/p250_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |23,,
wav48/p250/p250_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |23,,
wav48/p250/p250_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |23,,
wav48/p250/p250_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|23,,
wav48/p250/p250_025.wav|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_026.wav|Meetings will also remain private.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_027.wav|I am pretty careful with money.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_028.wav|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_030.wav|This is a central issue.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_031.wav|We will not tolerate it.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_032.wav|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_033.wav|He works at the airport.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_034.wav|Smoking is also very important.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_035.wav|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_036.wav|It was just appalling luck.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_037.wav|Rugby has an extended run.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_038.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.|23,,
wav48/p250/p250_039.wav|Costs have got to be controlled.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_040.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_042.wav|No meaningful response was issued.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_043.wav|This represents a tough game for us.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_044.wav|I made a terrible start.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_045.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_046.wav|How are you, sir ?|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_047.wav|So is that it, then ?|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_048.wav|Do I have a favourite ?|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_049.wav|It comes from reflection or thinking.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_050.wav|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_051.wav|Strikers like to go to the ground.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_052.wav|Planting is unlikely to start before next spring.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_053.wav|Pulled a huge number of viewers.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_054.wav|I had trouble with the producers.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_055.wav|The teacher would have approved.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_056.wav|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_057.wav|I expect a rapid response.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_058.wav|She said she was really sorry.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_059.wav|The problems are a result of that shortfall.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_060.wav|There's still plenty time left.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_061.wav|Let's hope that it does.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_062.wav|We have to keep our clients.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_063.wav|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_064.wav|Companies are now seeking to recover their losses.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_065.wav|This is the first step.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_066.wav|We will pay their bills.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_067.wav|We are talking about the outskirts of London.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_068.wav|The Farmer wants a new campaign.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_069.wav|Only water is currently allowed.|23,,,,

wav48/p250/p250_071.wav|He later became a respected High Court judge.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_072.wav|Robin Williams is very subdued.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_073.wav|It wasn't possible to relax.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_074.wav|We need to increase the membership.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_075.wav|There's nothing they can get on me.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_076.wav|I was as strong as a horse.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_077.wav|He was a lovely man.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_078.wav|Both sides have been hit by injury.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_079.wav|We had a court hearing in London yesterday.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_080.wav|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_081.wav|It makes for an interesting conference.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_082.wav|I've had it for the exams.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_083.wav|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_084.wav|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_085.wav|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_086.wav|He put some colour into Scottish history.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_087.wav|They lived for their children.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_088.wav|Potions said he would drive.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_089.wav|I think the industry needs a big idea to rebuild confidence.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_090.wav|William Hague, the guest of honour, was delighted.|23,,
wav48/p250/p250_091.wav|We are progressing with a few interested parties.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_092.wav|That view is held by many others within the industry.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_093.wav|The excitement could hardly be contained.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_094.wav|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_095.wav|It is high time to act.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_096.wav|Why do it otherwise ?|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_097.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_098.wav|So, did she meet him ?|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_099.wav|So what is the campaign about ?|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_100.wav|And does it ?|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_101.wav|Are you from the rugby ?|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_102.wav|Had I heard ?|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_103.wav|It is an old family habit.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_104.wav|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_105.wav|He was released after treatment.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_106.wav|We have made no final decisions.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_107.wav|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_108.wav|We knew they could do it.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_109.wav|The vast bulk of its funds are run by Aberdeen.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_110.wav|They must be on commission.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_111.wav|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_113.wav|Mr Wilson has received no such request.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_114.wav|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_115.wav|It's good to have a voice.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_116.wav|He was prepared for this.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_117.wav|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_118.wav|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_119.wav|No, the equipment is extra.|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_120.wav|It didn't come as any great surprise.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_121.wav|Prospects for equity markets remain uncertain.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_123.wav|It has been a nightmare of frustration.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_124.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_125.wav|I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_126.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_127.wav|I understand the medical concerns.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_128.wav|That's not an assumption that I had made.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_129.wav|I have learned from him.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_130.wav|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_131.wav|He thought she was amazing.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_132.wav|Figures are not relevant to the strategy.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_133.wav|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_134.wav|It isn't a happy memory.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_135.wav|We have a team to reach the final.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_136.wav|Failure is not an option.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_137.wav|She's got to say something.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_138.wav|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_139.wav|This is a frightening development.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_140.wav|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_141.wav|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_142.wav|That is far too high.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_143.wav|My life has changed a lot.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_144.wav|We did what we had to do.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_146.wav|You've got to be vigilant.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_147.wav|You are a gambling man.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_148.wav|I had decided to quit the show.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_149.wav|Losing in that manner is very hard to take.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_150.wav|It was finally agreed on Saturday.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_151.wav|I love the spectacle of cinema.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_152.wav|We will try to find someone.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_153.wav|She died at her home.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_154.wav|What happened in that game ?|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_155.wav|Are you going to win ?|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_156.wav|Was it the wife ?|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_157.wav|Why change it ?|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_158.wav|What do we want to do that for ?|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_159.wav|Frankly, it was worth the booking.|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_160.wav|He was pleased with his display.|23,,,,

wav48/p250/p250_162.wav|It is not just about pay.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_163.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_164.wav|Anyway, the job will be part-time.|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_165.wav|It has become a way of life.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_166.wav|The whole industry is a shambles.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_167.wav|People were actually not on his side.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_168.wav|The defender made an impressive debut.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_169.wav|There's only one team in Ayrshire.|23,,,,

wav48/p250/p250_175.wav|He was asked to quit.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_176.wav|This action reflects a slump in bookings.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_177.wav|Being involved at that level is like an addiction.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_178.wav|I'd love to be like Peter.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_179.wav|You will be very welcome.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_180.wav|It had so much to do with output.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_181.wav|That would open the gates of hell.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_182.wav|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_183.wav|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_184.wav|They could not match it.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_185.wav|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_186.wav|But the petrol station does not get the benefit.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_187.wav|This championship is different from the other majors.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_188.wav|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_189.wav|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_190.wav|The new scheme will have its own terms and conditions.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_191.wav|Our fans have been marvellous.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_192.wav|This could be an amazing attraction for Glasgow.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_193.wav|They need to look after themselves.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_194.wav|Miller was every bit as happy.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_195.wav|They were seriously after him.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_196.wav|It was a bit like having children.|23,,,,

wav48/p250/p250_200.wav|We always felt we could win.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_201.wav|It may have been a cry for help.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_202.wav|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_204.wav|We are going through difficult times.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_205.wav|We've had an enjoyable adventure.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_206.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.|23,,
wav48/p250/p250_207.wav|You could feel the heat.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_208.wav|We have to be happy with a British and European record.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_209.wav|It was a moment of madness.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_210.wav|And we have the experience.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_211.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.|23,,,,

wav48/p250/p250_215.wav|British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_216.wav|It was worth a photograph.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_217.wav|The move follows a review of the Singapore|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_218.wav|It carried a double message.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_219.wav|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_220.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_221.wav|That might help a bit.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_222.wav|Does the name matter ?|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_223.wav|how do you get it back ?|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_224.wav|What are you not good at ?|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_225.wav|I think, therefore I am ?|23,,,

wav48/p250/p250_231.wav|His third goal was superb.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_232.wav|It will affect their work.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_233.wav|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_234.wav|I am considered a teenager.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_235.wav|The process will start tomorrow.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_236.wav|It's just a normal life.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_237.wav|The transaction is not feasible.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_238.wav|I wouldn't even respond to that question.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_239.wav|It is good for our team.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_240.wav|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_241.wav|That you can do it.|23,,,,

wav48/p250/p250_251.wav|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_252.wav|The most important thing is the game.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_253.wav|There is no timetable for completing such inquiries.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_254.wav|Paterson can afford to be generous.|23,,,,

wav48/p250/p250_263.wav|He needed a kidney - it is as simple as that.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_264.wav|He is a reporter for us.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_265.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_266.wav|Either way, the investor retains the premium.|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_267.wav|We've had several problems over injuries.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_268.wav|That was a disgraceful performance.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_269.wav|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_270.wav|It was a kind of contempt.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_271.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.|23,,
wav48/p250/p250_272.wav|I should think so, too.|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_273.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.|23,,,,

wav48/p250/p250_275.wav|I got a yellow card.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_276.wav|This is no reflection on Rangers.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_277.wav|We accept the new rules.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_278.wav|They are interior designers and architects.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_280.wav|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_281.wav|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_282.wav|We are aiming for early March.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_283.wav|I felt about this big.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_284.wav|And they were being paid ?|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_285.wav|was everything done to save people ?|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_286.wav|What was the matter for concern ?|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_287.wav|Do I think about them often ?|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_288.wav|Is it in the right place ?|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_289.wav|It is also very valuable.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_290.wav|I feel really confident in that department.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_291.wav|This could put pressure on UK inflation.|23,,,,

wav48/p250/p250_299.wav|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_300.wav|I understand the security issue.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_301.wav|Frankly, we should all have such problems.|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_302.wav|It was an easy decision to come here.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_304.wav|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_305.wav|Funding would come from both Scotland and Northern Ireland.|23,,,,

wav48/p250/p250_310.wav|You have to expect this type of thing.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_311.wav|Stephen will get his first cap.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_312.wav|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_313.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_314.wav|The circumstances have changed since last year.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_315.wav|It's all designed to speed up the service.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_316.wav|I wanted to change the formula.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_317.wav|He will address the nation this evening.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_318.wav|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_319.wav|Motherwell have no such good fortune.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_320.wav|We would hope to make progress on that next year.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_321.wav|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_322.wav|The effect was almost magical.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_323.wav|And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_324.wav|Holland won by five wickets.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_325.wav|There's still no-one like him.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_326.wav|McNaughton was not so sure.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_327.wav|I was brought up in a mining background.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_328.wav|I thought his speech was a disgrace.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_329.wav|The takeover comes as no surprise.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_330.wav|Job losses were also announced.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_331.wav|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_332.wav|We believe the world has too many refugees already.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_333.wav|The party lasted all night.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_334.wav|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_335.wav|It was nice to finish in style.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_336.wav|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_337.wav|Completion of the purchase is seen by the end of the year.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_338.wav|And he goes with it.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_339.wav|SCOTLAND has shown the way.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_340.wav|There will be good prospects ahead.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_341.wav|Will have consequences for Scottish universities.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_342.wav|The letters are going out today.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_343.wav|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_344.wav|We will listen to any suggestion.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_345.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_346.wav|He has made his base in Spain.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_348.wav|A Home Office spokesman said.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_349.wav|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_350.wav|That is a trend which will be encouraged.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_351.wav|It was tough to contain the excitement.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_352.wav|The pain is still acute.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_353.wav|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_354.wav|It's wonderful to have won.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_355.wav|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_356.wav|I'd like to take the plunge.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_357.wav|Finally came the moment of truth.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_358.wav|We have very limited capacity.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_359.wav|Is our children learning ?|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_360.wav|What form did that take ?|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_361.wav|Are they free ?|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_362.wav|Is there a waiting list ?|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_363.wav|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_364.wav|Three years ago he would have been.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_365.wav|It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.|23,,,,

wav48/p250/p250_367.wav|The Allies intend to maintain the average.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_368.wav|We put our bid in last night.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_369.wav|He had no access to the database.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_370.wav|We're still the only ones in the High Street.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_371.wav|I was delighted to accept.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_372.wav|They should take their mobile phones.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_374.wav|It's fantastic to win again.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_375.wav|We are really good friends.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_376.wav|The salary changes are long overdue.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_377.wav|Those people must be accountable.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_378.wav|She said they would appeal.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_379.wav|The countryside is in crisis.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_380.wav|There is no deal as yet.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_381.wav|It's as wide as a church in here.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_382.wav|She is obviously very disappointed.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_383.wav|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_384.wav|They will fight for everything.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_385.wav|We will win the argument.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_386.wav|Is it worth it ?|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_387.wav|Does it matter ?|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_388.wav|How do you take them away ?|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_389.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?|23,,
wav48/p250/p250_390.wav|After the match, do you ?|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_391.wav|The team hadn't been picked.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_392.wav|No other job in world football can compare to this one.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_393.wav|One-third of the places are already taken.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_394.wav|I always knew she was funny.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_395.wav|Everyone could see the joke.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_396.wav|The marshall at the turn was great.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_397.wav|There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_398.wav|He has earned the right to their respect.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_399.wav|The law would appear to be on our side.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_400.wav|There was a substantial explosion.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_401.wav|The hope is that the outcome will be equally successful.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_402.wav|Theatre is not a museum.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_403.wav|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_404.wav|It has only been rumours.|23,,,,

wav48/p250/p250_406.wav|Rugby is a hard game.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_407.wav|My immune system had been depleted.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_408.wav|Offence to the herd was not easily overlooked.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_409.wav|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_410.wav|Growth will come later in the cycle.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_411.wav|We're not taking any risks.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_412.wav|Neither man has been charged.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_413.wav|I had a fortunate war.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_414.wav|The choice is strictly personal.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_415.wav|It's too close to call.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_416.wav|The breakdown was much later in her life.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_417.wav|It became a national network.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_418.wav|It is a large number.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_419.wav|She started to put on weight.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_420.wav|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_421.wav|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_422.wav|The BBC was a disgrace.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_423.wav|Russell is delighted with them.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_424.wav|The next few months will tell.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_425.wav|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_426.wav|The second goal was superb.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_427.wav|I am astonished at attack.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_428.wav|There is a solution, she believes.|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_429.wav|That was the agreement with the manager.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_430.wav|He's had to suffer for the last six years.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_431.wav|His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_432.wav|Being captain of this club is fantastic.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_433.wav|First Minister Donald Dewar will respond.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_434.wav|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_435.wav|No date has been fixed for his return.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_436.wav|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_437.wav|The trial will open today.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_438.wav|National Farmer's Union of Scotland president, Jim Walker, welcomed the new proposals.|23,,
wav48/p250/p250_439.wav|I never won a penny throughout my career.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_440.wav|THIS is a good day for Scottish farming.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_441.wav|There were a lot of emotions.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_442.wav|We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_443.wav|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_444.wav|We know about the crisis in cattle.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_445.wav|Everything in golf is a balance.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_446.wav|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_447.wav|External auditors will monitor the action which is planned.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_448.wav|The people around me were fantastic.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_449.wav|That will be best for him.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_450.wav|And we might go back.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_451.wav|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_452.wav|The villagers were shot in the head at short range.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_453.wav|But you can go beyond that condition.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_454.wav|The removal would take place in France.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_455.wav|It is a tough game but we have a chance.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_456.wav|But we have built a platform for next season.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_457.wav|I think the goalkeeper should have gone.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_458.wav|They had learned from the lessons of the first game.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_459.wav|The jury is still out.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_460.wav|It was like someone had died.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_461.wav|The budget was too low for that.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_462.wav|Neither club is going to have much time for a decent runner-up.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_463.wav|Striking the deal has come as a big relief.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_464.wav|The damage is all inside.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_465.wav|Let that be their memorial.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_466.wav|The boys are mentally focused.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_467.wav|This is the stuff of live music.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_468.wav|It may prove to be his last involvement with the club.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_469.wav|The move is considered a major breakthrough.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_471.wav|I see no reason to have this debate at this time.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_472.wav|He certainly did a good job!|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_473.wav|Talks between directors have been underway since last month.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_474.wav|I am certainly thinking about retirement.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_475.wav|At the moment, social workers take the lead on child protection issues.|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_476.wav|I have always believed in myself.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_477.wav|The chief constable has retired.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_478.wav|Well, he is an artist.|23,,,
wav48/p250/p250_479.wav|Her body was found about four miles from the car.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_480.wav|The casting of her husband was an accident.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_481.wav|Their coach is obviously under a lot of pressure.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_482.wav|That was the first time I worked with Richard.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_483.wav|That argument has been won.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_484.wav|It was a narrow escape.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_485.wav|And rugby fans can help.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_486.wav|He was certainly upbeat about his chances.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_487.wav|The processing plant was closed yesterday.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_488.wav|The Israeli military denied the claim.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_489.wav|He is not a dancer.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_490.wav|I cannot explain the grief and pain in my heart.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_491.wav|IT HAS been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_492.wav|These people attack the core of my beliefs.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_493.wav|The striker needed attention before he could resume.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_494.wav|I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_495.wav|We would welcome a commercial partner or partners.|23,,,,
wav48/p250/p250_496.wav|Subsidy income will not be affected.|23,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_001.wav|Please call Stella. |24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |24,,
wav48/p251/p251_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |24,,
wav48/p251/p251_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |24,,
wav48/p251/p251_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |24,,
wav48/p251/p251_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|24,,
wav48/p251/p251_025.wav|Johnson was pretty low.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_026.wav|But it failed.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_027.wav|That's no bad thing.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_028.wav|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_029.wav|However, the following year the cancer returned.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_030.wav|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_032.wav|It's a matter of balance.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_033.wav|Peace was won.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_034.wav|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_035.wav|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_036.wav|Was it worth it?|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_037.wav|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_038.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_039.wav|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_040.wav|It was clear.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_041.wav|They may be wrong.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_042.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.|24,,
wav48/p251/p251_043.wav|Dancing was her life.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_044.wav|We will push.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_045.wav|I feel pretty good.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_046.wav|That should do it.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_047.wav|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_048.wav|As she explains.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_049.wav|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_050.wav|It is the whole package.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_051.wav|He had no enemies.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_052.wav|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_053.wav|We were surprised to see the photograph.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_054.wav|I had relied on him.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_055.wav|This is a step backwards.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_056.wav|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_057.wav|What was the main difference?|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_058.wav|Four other charges were dropped.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_059.wav|It's a real challenge.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_060.wav|It is not great art.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_061.wav|They're appalled by that.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_062.wav|It's that kind of place.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_063.wav|It was all in a short period of time.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_064.wav|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_065.wav|And if he hadn't become a musician?|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_066.wav|He was popular.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_067.wav|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_068.wav|That was the easy election.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_069.wav|There could be a way back.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_070.wav|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_071.wav|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_072.wav|It was chaotic.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_073.wav|It is a time bomb.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_074.wav|I've not thought about it.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_075.wav|Today she has been released.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_076.wav|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_077.wav|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_078.wav|I was too young.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_079.wav|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_080.wav|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_081.wav|War is not the action.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_082.wav|You will be.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_083.wav|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_084.wav|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_085.wav|We have turned the corner.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_087.wav|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_088.wav|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_089.wav|We must look forward.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_090.wav|It is an old family habit.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_091.wav|Until you hit the big games.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_092.wav|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.|24,,
wav48/p251/p251_093.wav|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_094.wav|If you could find it.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_095.wav|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_096.wav|Journalists should make him.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_097.wav|They were outside the circle.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_098.wav|Two of the team became ill.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_099.wav|That would be unlawful.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_100.wav|No date has been set for the appeal.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_101.wav|It is a good lifestyle.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_102.wav|That is no use.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_103.wav|They had to be cut from the wreckage.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_104.wav|Further protests are likely.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_105.wav|I was fighting for my life, I thought.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_106.wav|He was jailed for a year.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_107.wav|It had been played at festivals.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_108.wav|I came to complete.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_109.wav|You had better believe it.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_110.wav|I was angry.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_111.wav|The fire was above the hole.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_112.wav|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_113.wav|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_114.wav|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_115.wav|Maybe this battle has been.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_116.wav|I joined a group.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_117.wav|Does this mean.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_118.wav|It is rubbish.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_119.wav|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_120.wav|We work on the same level.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_121.wav|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_122.wav|She has been shot.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_123.wav|I'm so angry.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_124.wav|It's terrible that he has died the same way.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_125.wav|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_126.wav|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_127.wav|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_128.wav|Well, you can have a tree.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_129.wav|It was the same at Twickenham.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_130.wav|We had a reunion last week.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_131.wav|If not, a deal could take many months.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_132.wav|Government will intervene.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_133.wav|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_134.wav|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_135.wav|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_136.wav|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_137.wav|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_138.wav|Is that it?|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_139.wav|I had decided to quit the show.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_140.wav|I am totally devoted to this job.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_141.wav|Three penalties were given.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_142.wav|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_143.wav|We just had a go.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_144.wav|We have seen a copy of the report.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_145.wav|The songs are just so good.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_146.wav|It is like a football team.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_147.wav|That group reported just before Christmas.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_148.wav|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_149.wav|You know the type.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_150.wav|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_151.wav|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_152.wav|He seemed to lose his focus.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_153.wav|It is not normal practice.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_154.wav|There's a sense of excess in the novel.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_155.wav|I knew he was good.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_156.wav|I saw one body.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_157.wav|There's a pause.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_158.wav|Neither side can win this war.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_159.wav|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_160.wav|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_161.wav|Eight months later, he was dead.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_162.wav|We have to move forward.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_163.wav|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_164.wav|Tell it like it was?|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_165.wav|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.|24,,
wav48/p251/p251_166.wav|By then, however, both men were already in the US.|24,,
wav48/p251/p251_167.wav|You are not going in blind.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_168.wav|The post will be unpaid.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_169.wav|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_170.wav|They thought they had found a home.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_171.wav|I always felt they played for me.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_172.wav|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_173.wav|One season, they might do well.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_174.wav|The jury is still out.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_175.wav|We wanted it left for a wee while.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_176.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_177.wav|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_178.wav|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_179.wav|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_180.wav|We knew nothing about it.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_181.wav|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.|24,,
wav48/p251/p251_182.wav|Four policemen were wounded.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_183.wav|We did everything by the book.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_184.wav|What has caused the demise of singing?|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_185.wav|We want to help them through it.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_186.wav|I cannot say too much about them.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_187.wav|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_188.wav|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_189.wav|People will ask about us.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_190.wav|However, this idea is never developed.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_191.wav|Last night was a key episode.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_192.wav|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_193.wav|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_194.wav|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_195.wav|It is a case of taking a risk.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_196.wav|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.|24,,
wav48/p251/p251_197.wav|It wasn't to be.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_198.wav|It was typical.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_199.wav|It's the same old story.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_200.wav|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_201.wav|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_202.wav|There was no option.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_203.wav|The conference is the first test.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_204.wav|I saw some terrible things.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_205.wav|They've got three-quarters of the way.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_206.wav|A deadline is still essential.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_207.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.|24,,
wav48/p251/p251_208.wav|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_209.wav|Today was first class.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_210.wav|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_211.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_212.wav|We have an election in eight days.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_213.wav|Now, it's all right.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_214.wav|There was an e-mail.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_215.wav|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_216.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_217.wav|I began to pray.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_218.wav|A Grampian Police spokesman said.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_219.wav|We have got to get it right.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_220.wav|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_221.wav|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_222.wav|Work has started.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_223.wav|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_224.wav|It's just a place to open it.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_225.wav|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_226.wav|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_227.wav|IT S the real thing, for sure.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_228.wav|Women were mostly notable by their absence.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_230.wav|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_231.wav|We played them off the pitch.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_232.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_233.wav|It's a question of creating a future awareness.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_234.wav|I am immensely sad.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_235.wav|I'd never seen a play about me.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_236.wav|It is a gamble.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_237.wav|But he failed to win the committee's support.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_238.wav|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_239.wav|We were awful.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_240.wav|However, no further action was taken by police.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_241.wav|Police later said the scheme would end in November.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_242.wav|They had no children.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_243.wav|It is set in Paris.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_244.wav|They should come forward.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_245.wav|It's quite a line-up!|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_246.wav|I think a move would create a lot of interest.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_247.wav|It would still have been a good film, but very different.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_248.wav|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_249.wav|Of further privacy, he had no need.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_250.wav|My future is in the marathon.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_251.wav|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_252.wav|We have a free vote on these things in our party.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_253.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_254.wav|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_255.wav|It is hard won.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_256.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_257.wav|Chambers said he would accept the place.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_258.wav|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_259.wav|They tried to give her advice.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_260.wav|His body was never found.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_262.wav|He's a lovely young man.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_263.wav|It was a hit.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_264.wav|We are ready.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_265.wav|They know no other way.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_266.wav|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_267.wav|We run within the law.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_268.wav|They are interior designers and architects.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_269.wav|Kirkwood was arrested.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_270.wav|they fail to engage.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_271.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_272.wav|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.|24,,
wav48/p251/p251_273.wav|I was happily surprised.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_274.wav|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_275.wav|I am very angry.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_276.wav|Today we can say that a new era has begun.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_278.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_279.wav|Rehearsals will start in the new year for the extended season.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_280.wav|He thought he had a month to cross the street.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_281.wav|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_282.wav|That's the only thing I will say.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_283.wav|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_284.wav|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_285.wav|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_286.wav|He has not created a Festival resource.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_287.wav|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_288.wav|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_289.wav|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_290.wav|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_291.wav|We're in shock.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_292.wav|Our objective is to tackle poverty.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_293.wav|One knows the feeling.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_294.wav|Things can change.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_295.wav|It's a way of life.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_296.wav|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_297.wav|I am an estate agent.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_298.wav|People have no choice.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_299.wav|She looked so young.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_300.wav|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_301.wav|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_302.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_303.wav|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_304.wav|You've got to have both sides.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_305.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_306.wav|Who will perform?|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_307.wav|This is a national crisis.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_308.wav|Scotland were beaten again.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_309.wav|Who did the recruiting?|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_310.wav|She said she could not believe that they had run away.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_311.wav|For the moment, our position remains the same.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_312.wav|The results are sometimes contentious.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_313.wav|These figures are truly awful.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_314.wav|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_315.wav|A new school will be built.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_316.wav|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_317.wav|We have to sort it out ourselves.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_318.wav|He said she was mad.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_319.wav|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_320.wav|Our task is to complete the picture.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_321.wav|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_322.wav|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_323.wav|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_324.wav|You are the glory.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_325.wav|The letters are going out today.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_326.wav|In fact, they have the opposite effect.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_327.wav|We are a peaceful people.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_328.wav|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_329.wav|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_330.wav|It is out there.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_331.wav|They had a confession.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_332.wav|However, the groups denied the claims.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_333.wav|That is a trend which will be encouraged.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_334.wav|That's the law of the land.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_335.wav|There was no time scale.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_336.wav|In his absence, the council adopted the change.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_337.wav|It's not long enough.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_338.wav|I am so upset.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_339.wav|He was not a big name.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_340.wav|The police have to act to help them.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_341.wav|It could have gone either way.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_342.wav|Is that an issue?|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_343.wav|He can do no wrong.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_344.wav|Finally, he paid for the movie.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_345.wav|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_346.wav|In Scotland, we keep the faith.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_347.wav|The team for the first game could be this one.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_348.wav|The same things will happen with GM foods.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_349.wav|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_350.wav|He did a good job.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_351.wav|We haven't had any adverse reaction to the project.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_352.wav|Well, it won't.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_353.wav|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_355.wav|I'm very lucky.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_356.wav|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_357.wav|The composer will conduct.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_359.wav|It is not like working for a living.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_360.wav|They got upset.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_361.wav|I saw some good things.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_362.wav|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_364.wav|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_365.wav|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_366.wav|However, it was well worth the wait.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_367.wav|He has seen the past.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_368.wav|We will be homeless.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_369.wav|That would help.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_372.wav|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.|24,,,,
wav48/p251/p251_373.wav|It's not pretty, but it's effective.|24,,,
wav48/p251/p251_374.wav|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.|24,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_001.wav|Please call Stella. |25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |25,,
wav48/p252/p252_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |25,,,
wav48/p252/p252_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |25,,,
wav48/p252/p252_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |25,,
wav48/p252/p252_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |25,,
wav48/p252/p252_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |25,,,
wav48/p252/p252_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |25,,,
wav48/p252/p252_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |25,,,
wav48/p252/p252_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored bands increases as the size of the drops increases. |25,,,
wav48/p252/p252_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-position of a number of bows. |25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |25,,
wav48/p252/p252_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|25,,
wav48/p252/p252_025.wav|Then nine minutes before half time Kenny Miller struck.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_026.wav|This would include insurance.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_027.wav|It would fit very well with us.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_028.wav|He does not even trust his own members.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_029.wav|Do not give your details to anyone.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_030.wav|Schools do not create that.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_032.wav|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_033.wav|Just look at his fashion sense.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_034.wav|I have every confidence.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_035.wav|He added that her comments were noted.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_036.wav|We've got a real battle now with Richard.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_037.wav|Instead, we make the ground pay.|25,,,
wav48/p252/p252_038.wav|That time may never be broken.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_039.wav|Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_040.wav|He too started on the subs seats.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_041.wav|I'm so happy that she did.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_042.wav|We took part in a festival called Global Dance.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_043.wav|This operation will change her life.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_044.wav|Something old something new, as it were.|25,,,
wav48/p252/p252_045.wav|The youngsters have put us in a strong position.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_046.wav|They seem too much of a sure thing.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_047.wav|That's what set him apart.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_048.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_050.wav|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_051.wav|She continued to enjoy sport.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_052.wav|Downing Street also rejected the calls for a European army.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_053.wav|By all accounts he was delighted.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_054.wav|Schools will not want change.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_055.wav|I think I'm a bit too young.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_056.wav|He was failed by his health authority.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_057.wav|We wish to win, but not at any price.|25,,,
wav48/p252/p252_058.wav|I agree with you about this.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_059.wav|Or so he thought.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_060.wav|Must be prepared to use it.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_061.wav|The fifth was found later.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_062.wav|For a decade she was proved right.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_063.wav|It was dangerous but vital employment.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_064.wav|Our people are ready.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_065.wav|These figures cover the major British banking groups.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_066.wav|Probably he wasn't thinking at all.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_067.wav|Some of their players seemed almost dead.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_068.wav|People come to see the Highlands.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_069.wav|It would have to be.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_071.wav|This is a great opportunity for us.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_072.wav|That is not possible.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_073.wav|None has ever been found.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_074.wav|Insurance will perhaps reduce.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_075.wav|Their time has gone.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_076.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_077.wav|How are you, sir ?|25,,,
wav48/p252/p252_078.wav|So is that it, then ?|25,,,
wav48/p252/p252_079.wav|Do I have a favourite ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_080.wav|What do we do ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_081.wav|Why do it otherwise ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_082.wav|What kind of a man does that, Mr Dick ?|25,,,
wav48/p252/p252_083.wav|Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_084.wav|He has a real potential.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_085.wav|LET there be light.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_086.wav|I can't remember a lot about the accident.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_087.wav|Scotland has great assets.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_088.wav|That remains the same.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_089.wav|It was exactly four months away.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_090.wav|There is no issue of national security involved here.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_091.wav|Earlier, both main parties agreed a crucial stage had been reached.|25,,,
wav48/p252/p252_092.wav|Put simply, it goes something like this.|25,,,
wav48/p252/p252_093.wav|Even if he doesn't have any lines.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_094.wav|The car driver died.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_095.wav|It looks that way.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_096.wav|Now comes the hard part.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_097.wav|We are already seeing some positive results.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_098.wav|We're at home, which is important.|25,,,
wav48/p252/p252_099.wav|They prepared some food very quickly.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_100.wav|The circumstances have changed since last year.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_101.wav|In his new cabinet role as party chairman, it will become his primary task.|25,,,
wav48/p252/p252_102.wav|They had three children.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_103.wav|Some young girls also came by last night.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_104.wav|The idea is the shop within a shop.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_105.wav|It would be easy to think so.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_106.wav|And so it went on.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_108.wav|Scotland were on Saturday.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_109.wav|We want the results as soon as possible before Thursday.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_110.wav|He gets his moment.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_111.wav|The newspapers, by contrast, had held their value.|25,,
wav48/p252/p252_112.wav|There was no reason.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_113.wav|It gets too much.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_114.wav|So they should be.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_115.wav|No progress has been made.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_116.wav|They need the money.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_117.wav|That is the only way to rate players.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_118.wav|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_119.wav|Its failure is no surprise.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_120.wav|No country has a similar training programme.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_121.wav|Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_122.wav|Consumers will also benefit.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_123.wav|They pointed to the site.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_124.wav|Tony Blair said as little.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_125.wav|He is at peace with himself.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_126.wav|Gold admitted as much.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_127.wav|It seemed like four hours.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_128.wav|Evidence must not be held back.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_129.wav|We beat the Welsh team.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_130.wav|I saw a lot of good things against Livingston.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_131.wav|Britain's role was to stop it.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_132.wav|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.|25,,,
wav48/p252/p252_133.wav|Eight others have followed.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_134.wav|We're currently looking at the level of support.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_135.wav|Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.|25,,,
wav48/p252/p252_136.wav|Strong growth is expected from the industrial services division.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_137.wav|It's nice to see a very positive style of football.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_138.wav|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.|25,,,
wav48/p252/p252_139.wav|It should have its own network.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_140.wav|As our national coach, Brown is done for.|25,,,
wav48/p252/p252_141.wav|But this wasn't the full picture.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_142.wav|That shows the impact it had.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_143.wav|Domestic orders have also fallen since January.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_144.wav|I'd always wanted to act.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_145.wav|We hope he will do until he finally does the double.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_146.wav|That is a big risk at any price.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_147.wav|I am never fully fit.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_148.wav|Are you going to win ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_149.wav|Was it the wife ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_150.wav|Why change it ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_151.wav|What do we want to do that for ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_152.wav|Does the name matter ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_153.wav|how do you get it back ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_154.wav|What are you not good at ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_155.wav|I think, therefore I am ?|25,,,
wav48/p252/p252_156.wav|Who was she ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_157.wav|He said some things which were better left alone.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_158.wav|He nearly killed my son.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_160.wav|Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.|25,,,
wav48/p252/p252_161.wav|I told them during their morning break.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_162.wav|Parents of pupils at the school have also expressed concern.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_163.wav|Mr Dewar understood that.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_164.wav|Nato has left them with no other option.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_165.wav|They have shown great character.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_166.wav|I am secure in my own position.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_167.wav|It wasn't a pretty match.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_168.wav|Health experts said they were not surprised by the findings.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_169.wav|Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_170.wav|The second failed completely.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_171.wav|That apart, though, I feel good.|25,,
wav48/p252/p252_172.wav|We have come a long way since then.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_173.wav|Sport is good for you.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_174.wav|It was clearly not a battle.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_175.wav|I made my mind up before we came on tour.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_176.wav|You are looking at specialist staff and specialist staff cost money.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_177.wav|I'd rather be in our position than Rangers.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_178.wav|All options are available.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_179.wav|I knew Donald Dewar.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_181.wav|Parents do not know very much about drugs.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_182.wav|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_183.wav|I've no idea how it works.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_184.wav|It is actually building on the existing business.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_185.wav|Maybe this battle had been.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_186.wav|Art can challenge our value system.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_187.wav|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_188.wav|London remained the favourite.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_189.wav|I've never had a year like this.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_190.wav|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_191.wav|She really suffered for her art.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_193.wav|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_194.wav|A child is not a product.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_195.wav|Which can happen any time.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_196.wav|Scottish Life was there over one year.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_197.wav|Now he is back on top again.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_198.wav|The hotel was huge.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_199.wav|And they were being paid ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_200.wav|was everything done to save people ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_201.wav|What was the matter for concern ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_202.wav|Do I think about them often ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_203.wav|Is it in the right place ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_204.wav|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_205.wav|This should begin in October.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_206.wav|There remains some Scottish influence, however.|25,,,
wav48/p252/p252_207.wav|My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_208.wav|The role was perfect for Russell.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_209.wav|The price was raised after massive demands from retail investors.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_210.wav|If not, a deal could take many months.|25,,,
wav48/p252/p252_211.wav|Their bodies were never found.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_212.wav|It plans to return to this field.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_213.wav|Business will continue as usual.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_214.wav|I want a free vote.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_215.wav|Fine, said the press officer.|25,,,
wav48/p252/p252_216.wav|The questions came quick and fast.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_217.wav|The Boys can speak about little else.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_218.wav|Her experience is certainly limited.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_219.wav|We tried four banks.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_220.wav|There is no doubt there's room for us.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_221.wav|The labour side had developed in the North area.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_222.wav|Good records have also been recognised by successful farmers.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_223.wav|Brian was last to join.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_224.wav|He has many offers from the English Premiership.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_225.wav|Now the door has opened.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_226.wav|I'd rather play well next week than here.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_227.wav|Her death is a huge blow.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_228.wav|The global market was about flat.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_229.wav|Three hit the target.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_230.wav|The idea is simple.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_231.wav|Despite his success, things began to fall apart.|25,,,
wav48/p252/p252_232.wav|It's used by Ayr Technical College.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_233.wav|The Queen was on the ball yesterday but off the Euro.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_234.wav|We know the problems.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_235.wav|Britain will be little affected.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_236.wav|There is a good reason for this.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_237.wav|You know the type.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_238.wav|The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_239.wav|The board do not own the company.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_240.wav|That time is not far away.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_241.wav|That's been the difference between the sides.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_242.wav|When I was training.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_243.wav|I did let myself down a bit.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_244.wav|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_245.wav|This is absolutely not true.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_246.wav|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_247.wav|It was a great evening.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_248.wav|We have several options.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_250.wav|Our focus remains on quality revenue.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_251.wav|Perhaps it will happen again.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_252.wav|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_253.wav|It is based on population rather than need.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_254.wav|We were leading by two goals.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_255.wav|It had happened on average once a week this year.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_256.wav|It is very much in the eye of the individual.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_258.wav|It was an accident.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_260.wav|My goals have never changed.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_262.wav|So we kept them waiting.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_263.wav|He makes time for everyone.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_264.wav|That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_265.wav|The proposal was rejected.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_266.wav|Look at a computer.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_267.wav|He did better then.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_268.wav|But the next day she paid for it.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_269.wav|We still think this trade is on the increase.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_270.wav|It is also hoped big name stars could be brought on board.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_271.wav|This was the perfect setting.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_273.wav|The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_274.wav|The long-term trend is equally clear.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_275.wav|I see no reason to doubt that the situation in Scotland is any different.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_276.wav|All films open tomorrow|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_277.wav|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.|25,,,
wav48/p252/p252_278.wav|Paul never gave up hope.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_279.wav|Those three goals in five minutes changed the game.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_280.wav|They bought the property four years ago.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_281.wav|I hope numbers will be up on last time.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_282.wav|Their only score of the half came from a penalty by Jones.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_283.wav|It is a dangerous sport.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_284.wav|Oil stocks also provided a boost.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_286.wav|The future might well be green after all.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_287.wav|They were seriously after him.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_288.wav|It was a bit like having children.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_289.wav|Aberdeen had little to offer.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_290.wav|Donald felt it would be an appropriate thing to do.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_291.wav|I'm interested in interesting work.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_292.wav|His season started this afternoon.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_293.wav|He is a good signing for Rangers.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_294.wav|White would like to buy further bus businesses.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_295.wav|Kenny and I are ready.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_296.wav|Friday night was a pretty good night.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_297.wav|He also worked on general building contracts in the area.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_298.wav|They have played their part.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_299.wav|He followed the Italian route.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_300.wav|Stephen had never considered the question of compensation.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_301.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_302.wav|So does every industry.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_303.wav|Tomorrow will be my last.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_304.wav|But there's also a love for the songs.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_305.wav|His career may also provide food for thought for Ferguson.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_306.wav|We must move on.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_307.wav|It's just an area of water.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_308.wav|We have achieved that.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_309.wav|Their eyes, however, told a different story.|25,,
wav48/p252/p252_310.wav|Good players have become bad.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_311.wav|Many events are down on numbers.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_312.wav|He had served his time.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_313.wav|It was a total surprise.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_314.wav|If a service doesn't pay it will go.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_315.wav|The process will start tomorrow.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_316.wav|Motherwell took them from half chances.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_317.wav|That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_319.wav|One finding emerged clearly.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_320.wav|There was no consultation with the executive and no need for any such consultation.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_321.wav|We lost to a poor team.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_322.wav|We are keen to see truth and justice.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_323.wav|We have clearly become well established.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_324.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.|25,,,
wav48/p252/p252_325.wav|Murray plays down return|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_326.wav|Other teams moved up too.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_327.wav|Not one person spoke badly.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_328.wav|We were caught out.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_329.wav|The performance continues to improve.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_330.wav|We want immediate action.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_331.wav|Our relationship has been very good.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_332.wav|Someone should tell them.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_333.wav|But it won't help British farmers.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_334.wav|Does that put pressure on us ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_335.wav|Did it work ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_336.wav|Do you think we are a top nation ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_337.wav|Is our children learning ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_338.wav|How independent is that ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_339.wav|Because I think it's there.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_340.wav|If we get the wrong candidate.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_341.wav|They emerged before the patients left hospital.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_342.wav|They will now remain split up.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_343.wav|We are a husband and wife team.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_344.wav|It was the September weekend after all.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_345.wav|He would add value.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_346.wav|Sources yesterday said the Royal Bank has declined to back him.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_347.wav|Those overseas offices were great.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_348.wav|That was our last chance to do something.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_349.wav|Maybe she is right.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_350.wav|I saw one man vote five times.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_351.wav|No plans for projects are yet in place.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_352.wav|No sport needs that sort of thing.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_353.wav|The senior management team will be drawn from both companies.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_354.wav|Any increase always has some effect.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_355.wav|What form did that take ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_356.wav|Are they free ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_357.wav|What are they for ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_358.wav|Is there a waiting list ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_359.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_360.wav|They had better be.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_361.wav|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_362.wav|He was a great human being.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_363.wav|That seems highly unlikely.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_364.wav|Still, I am delighted.|25,,,
wav48/p252/p252_365.wav|Analysts welcomed the news.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_366.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_367.wav|You will lose benefit because you have broken the rules.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_368.wav|They made such decisions in London.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_369.wav|Results of the survey are expected by the end of June.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_370.wav|The whole system is too complex.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_371.wav|He said legal action could be considered.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_372.wav|The European elections revealed a lack of interest and a lack of knowledge.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_373.wav|This is far too high.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_374.wav|These matters can't just be medical decisions.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_375.wav|If you believe in the blue and white.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_376.wav|We have no information on Iraq.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_378.wav|The referee faces a massive job.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_379.wav|That could be ready within another nine months.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_380.wav|Next league matches Kilmarnock.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_381.wav|An appeal was unlikely.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_382.wav|He said he had now written to Scottish Industry Minister Lord Macdonald.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_383.wav|I got dropped for that game.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_384.wav|No real attempt was made to get orders.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_385.wav|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_386.wav|This year I understood.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_387.wav|It's clearly a budget.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_388.wav|It's an option, but I can't really comment.|25,,,
wav48/p252/p252_389.wav|The women are victims here.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_390.wav|I'm not sure that's right.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_391.wav|I've kept him in touch with everything.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_392.wav|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_393.wav|There's nothing natural left.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_394.wav|He could still be President.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_395.wav|There's always a case.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_396.wav|The new manager must make tough decisions.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_397.wav|He has worked hard over the years.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_399.wav|It was too difficult.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_400.wav|We will miss him against Celtic.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_401.wav|I managed to do that.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_402.wav|So what happens next ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_403.wav|Had this been common practice ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_404.wav|What do they want us to do ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_405.wav|Is it worth it ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_406.wav|Does it matter ?|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_407.wav|The doctors are quite positive about my progress.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_408.wav|They had to have hospital treatment.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_409.wav|Five local people were injured.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_410.wav|All the dead were believed to have been French.|25,,,,
wav48/p252/p252_411.wav|I'd like to report a murder.|25,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_001.wav|Please call Stella. |26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |26,,
wav48/p253/p253_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |26,,
wav48/p253/p253_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |26,,
wav48/p253/p253_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky. |26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |26,,
wav48/p253/p253_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|26,,
wav48/p253/p253_025.wav|But it failed.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_026.wav|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_027.wav|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_028.wav|However, the following year the cancer returned.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_029.wav|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|26,,
wav48/p253/p253_030.wav|This is the window.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_031.wav|He was jailed for five years.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_032.wav|Help is needed.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_033.wav|Then, suddenly, they weren't.|26,,
wav48/p253/p253_034.wav|It is marvellous.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_035.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_036.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_037.wav|They're just different.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_038.wav|It was clear.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_039.wav|Indeed, he does.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_040.wav|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_041.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.|26,,
wav48/p253/p253_042.wav|Dancing was her life.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_043.wav|The ambition this year is to improve on last.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_044.wav|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_045.wav|They want to be entertained.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_046.wav|It's the only thing.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_047.wav|You had better believe it.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_048.wav|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.|26,,
wav48/p253/p253_049.wav|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_050.wav|A neighbour said.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_051.wav|It is bizarre.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_052.wav|There is no reason at all.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_053.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_054.wav|Every aspect of our play was first class.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_055.wav|Our people are ready.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_056.wav|Here's a clue.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_057.wav|I was lost.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_058.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.|26,,
wav48/p253/p253_059.wav|My fitness was very poor.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_060.wav|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_061.wav|It is unique.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_062.wav|I expect a rapid response.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_063.wav|It happened so quickly.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_064.wav|That's the truth.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_065.wav|It seems to have worked.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_066.wav|This is the first step.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_067.wav|And if he hadn't become a musician?|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_068.wav|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_069.wav|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_071.wav|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_072.wav|Robin Williams is very subdued.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_073.wav|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_074.wav|It could take some time.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_075.wav|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_076.wav|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.|26,,
wav48/p253/p253_077.wav|It is a job creation scheme.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_078.wav|The party is up for it.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_079.wav|People must remain vigilant.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_080.wav|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_081.wav|What has changed?|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_082.wav|I will miss him.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_083.wav|He is in the queue.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_084.wav|I first met him last summer.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_085.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_086.wav|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_087.wav|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_088.wav|They lived for their children.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_089.wav|The city council is a major property owner in the area.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_090.wav|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_091.wav|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_092.wav|We are on the path of change.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_093.wav|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_095.wav|Yet, it worked.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_096.wav|He's been hit by it.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_097.wav|I love the Dome.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_098.wav|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_099.wav|However, we have not come to any conclusions.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_100.wav|It is a love affair.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_101.wav|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_102.wav|They make a selective perception process.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_103.wav|Two of the team became ill.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_104.wav|That would be unlawful.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_106.wav|Oil embargo endorsed.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_107.wav|It was an adventure.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_108.wav|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_109.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_110.wav|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_111.wav|I was fighting for my life, I thought.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_112.wav|Is that right?|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_113.wav|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_114.wav|It's a shame.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_115.wav|It was the eighties.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_116.wav|It is so sad.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_117.wav|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_118.wav|The mood is upbeat.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_119.wav|It is rubbish.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_120.wav|Who would be a referee?|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_121.wav|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_122.wav|We enjoyed it today.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_123.wav|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_124.wav|Here, again, they were denied a voice.|26,,
wav48/p253/p253_125.wav|There were no grounds for his action.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_126.wav|I'm so angry.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_127.wav|She really suffered for her art.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_128.wav|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_129.wav|It's not a U-turn.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_130.wav|No production was achieved.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_131.wav|I am now unemployed.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_132.wav|We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_133.wav|It plans to return to this field.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_134.wav|We work well together.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_135.wav|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_136.wav|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_138.wav|I was dead.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_139.wav|I don't know the full story.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_140.wav|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_141.wav|She died at her home.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_142.wav|He realises his mistake.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_143.wav|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_144.wav|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.|26,,
wav48/p253/p253_145.wav|I was awful.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_146.wav|Who would have?|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_147.wav|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_148.wav|It is not just about pay.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_149.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_150.wav|There was a substantial explosion.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_151.wav|I was stunned.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_152.wav|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_153.wav|The weather forecast isn't good.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_154.wav|They have not been named.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_156.wav|My Dad is a hero.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_157.wav|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_158.wav|Words were not required.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_160.wav|Life becomes a song.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_161.wav|Well, he should know.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_162.wav|Was this element always there?|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_163.wav|These days are long gone.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_164.wav|I'd love to be like Peter.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_165.wav|I've put my own money into this project.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_167.wav|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_168.wav|I was in the train station overnight.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_169.wav|We have a budget in March.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_170.wav|We should do everything at a stroke.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_171.wav|You had to go and see him.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_173.wav|In a way he was.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_175.wav|Blair's response was weak.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_176.wav|As we worked.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_177.wav|We are the gateway to justice.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_178.wav|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_179.wav|The goals were good.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_180.wav|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_181.wav|It's an idea.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_182.wav|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_183.wav|They need to look after themselves.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_184.wav|I saw military vehicles in the distance.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_185.wav|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_186.wav|Does this matter?|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_187.wav|Our team is just so young.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_188.wav|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_189.wav|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_190.wav|It caused a lot of upset.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_191.wav|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_192.wav|We speak about the performance.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_194.wav|Peace was won.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_195.wav|It's a fact.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_196.wav|I came home by ambulance.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_197.wav|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_198.wav|Is that success?|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_199.wav|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_200.wav|Who will pay for this?|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_201.wav|It's all about money, money, money.|26,,
wav48/p253/p253_202.wav|Sadly, it can't.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_203.wav|It was worth a photograph.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_205.wav|We have an election in eight days.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_206.wav|Feel the heat?|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_207.wav|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_208.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_209.wav|It had all been arranged.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_211.wav|Work has started.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_212.wav|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_213.wav|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_214.wav|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_215.wav|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_216.wav|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_217.wav|Then another one came.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_218.wav|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_219.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_220.wav|Clearly, the stakes are high.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_221.wav|It's a question of creating a future awareness.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_222.wav|I'd never seen a play about me.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_223.wav|It's not before time.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_224.wav|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_225.wav|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_226.wav|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_227.wav|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.|26,,
wav48/p253/p253_228.wav|My wife and family are the support system.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_229.wav|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_230.wav|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_231.wav|We are so proud.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_232.wav|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_233.wav|Of course I was tempted.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_234.wav|It's quite a line-up!|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_235.wav|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_236.wav|The minister is the engineer.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_237.wav|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_238.wav|It is hard won.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_239.wav|Our policy is clear.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_240.wav|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_241.wav|The scene is about this?|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_242.wav|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_243.wav|My son was too young to die.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_244.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_245.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.|26,,
wav48/p253/p253_247.wav|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_248.wav|That could be in place by next year.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_249.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_250.wav|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_251.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_252.wav|they fail to engage.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_253.wav|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_254.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_255.wav|They must play for each other.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_256.wav|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_257.wav|There's not much money in cycling.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_258.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_260.wav|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_261.wav|He has not created a Festival resource.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_262.wav|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_263.wav|He was also married with two children.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_264.wav|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_265.wav|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_266.wav|Our objective is to tackle poverty.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_267.wav|One knows the feeling.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_268.wav|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.|26,,
wav48/p253/p253_269.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_270.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_271.wav|She failed in her action.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_272.wav|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_273.wav|She looked so young.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_274.wav|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_275.wav|It's so awful.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_276.wav|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_277.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_278.wav|You've got to have both sides.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_279.wav|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_280.wav|Dialogue is the key.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_281.wav|They have shown a great desire and attitude.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_282.wav|She is an expert on medical ethics.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_283.wav|Who will perform?|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_285.wav|Who did the recruiting?|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_287.wav|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_288.wav|I was the sheep.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_289.wav|I was brought up in a mining background.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_290.wav|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_291.wav|Nothing is safe.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_292.wav|But it's a subtle process.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_293.wav|One was a lawyer.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_294.wav|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_296.wav|They are wrong.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_297.wav|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_298.wav|There were no passengers on board.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_299.wav|It could work.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_300.wav|This is a war over our home.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_301.wav|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_302.wav|There's no evidence he was ever there.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_303.wav|You should be.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_304.wav|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.|26,,
wav48/p253/p253_305.wav|The letters are going out today.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_307.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_308.wav|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.|26,,
wav48/p253/p253_309.wav|She is very distinctive.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_310.wav|We have got to get the points from this one.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_311.wav|You may have a short memory.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_313.wav|We are in the end game.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_314.wav|It will work.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_316.wav|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_317.wav|Our message was inclusive.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_318.wav|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_319.wav|Feel the air, the space.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_320.wav|Is there a new way forward?|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_322.wav|The figures are bad, but not that bad.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_323.wav|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_324.wav|However, they will only be found in the wild.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_326.wav|Three years ago he would have been.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_327.wav|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_328.wav|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.|26,,
wav48/p253/p253_329.wav|Two people were interviewed.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_330.wav|I've got no secret.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_331.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_332.wav|This is a friendly match?|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_333.wav|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_334.wav|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_335.wav|They should take their mobile phones.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_336.wav|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_337.wav|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_338.wav|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_339.wav|She is free.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_340.wav|Both of those promises have already been honoured.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_341.wav|Tyson is overwhelmed.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_342.wav|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_343.wav|Yet he left a few days later.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_344.wav|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_345.wav|As, indeed, they would be.|26,,
wav48/p253/p253_346.wav|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_348.wav|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_349.wav|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_350.wav|That would help.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_351.wav|My husband was angry.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_352.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_354.wav|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_355.wav|This is a club on the rise.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_356.wav|It's not pretty, but it's effective.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_357.wav|Their time has gone.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_358.wav|He could make it.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_359.wav|The death rates are still as high.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_360.wav|Now, though, he has an incentive.|26,,
wav48/p253/p253_361.wav|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_363.wav|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_364.wav|It is a simple equation.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_365.wav|By that time, however, it was already too late.|26,,
wav48/p253/p253_366.wav|It was a funny game.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_367.wav|There wasn't a goal.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_368.wav|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_369.wav|Colour was at the core of his life.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_371.wav|I'm still an amateur in that sense.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_372.wav|The Cabinet is split over the issue.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_373.wav|Something is wrong.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_374.wav|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_375.wav|That's the name of the game, though.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_376.wav|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_377.wav|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_378.wav|Does that put pressure on us?|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_379.wav|At the last I found a bunker.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_380.wav|Yet the data is compelling.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_381.wav|It's a real problem.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_382.wav|It's just outrageous.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_383.wav|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_384.wav|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_385.wav|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.|26,,
wav48/p253/p253_386.wav|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_387.wav|They are good.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_388.wav|I'm glad I came.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_390.wav|I've had my time.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_391.wav|It will take place in July.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_392.wav|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_394.wav|But, in fact, the reverse is true.|26,,
wav48/p253/p253_397.wav|What would be the point?|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_399.wav|It might be.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_400.wav|The weekly average was three hours.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_401.wav|Relief was beyond belief.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_402.wav|He got his degree.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_403.wav|went on sale.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_404.wav|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.|26,,,
wav48/p253/p253_405.wav|Until they came to do it.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_407.wav|That may be.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_408.wav|It is legally binding.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_409.wav|We went straight into the bedroom.|26,,,,
wav48/p253/p253_410.wav|Is there any prospect of this happening?|26,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_001.wav|Please call Stella. |27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |27,,
wav48/p254/p254_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |27,,
wav48/p254/p254_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |27,,
wav48/p254/p254_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |27,,
wav48/p254/p254_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|27,,
wav48/p254/p254_025.wav|Johnson was pretty low.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_026.wav|But it failed.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_027.wav|They may be wrong.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_028.wav|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_029.wav|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_030.wav|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_031.wav|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_032.wav|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_033.wav|It's a matter of balance.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_034.wav|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_035.wav|Then, suddenly, they weren't.|27,,
wav48/p254/p254_037.wav|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_038.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_039.wav|They're just different.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_040.wav|It was clear.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_041.wav|It is not for any other purpose.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_042.wav|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_043.wav|I was scared.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_044.wav|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_045.wav|No meaningful response was issued.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_046.wav|That period was a struggle.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_047.wav|I am just going to go for it.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_048.wav|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_049.wav|This represents a tough game for us.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_050.wav|It's a crucial award.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_051.wav|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_052.wav|That should do it.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_053.wav|It's a blessing.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_054.wav|Is a drug dealer?|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_055.wav|But it might have done.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_056.wav|That time has passed.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_057.wav|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_058.wav|He is too weak to move.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_059.wav|Life is good.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_060.wav|It is the whole package.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_061.wav|This is a club on the rise.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_062.wav|He had no enemies.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_063.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.|27,,
wav48/p254/p254_064.wav|We were surprised to see the photograph.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_065.wav|That's the day job.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_066.wav|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_067.wav|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_068.wav|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_069.wav|My mother is a widow.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_070.wav|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_071.wav|Jobs could go.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_072.wav|Four other charges were dropped.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_073.wav|They're appalled by that.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_074.wav|There was a battle there.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_075.wav|It's good news and long overdue.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_076.wav|And if he hadn't become a musician?|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_077.wav|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_078.wav|They never gave up hope.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_079.wav|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_080.wav|Painful, but only because it's true.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_081.wav|It's all I can do.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_082.wav|The company yesterday refused to comment.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_083.wav|Both sides have been hit by injury.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_084.wav|The price cuts are really exciting.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_085.wav|My office is bare.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_086.wav|Is there a new way forward?|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_087.wav|There was an e-mail.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_088.wav|Even the one she loved.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_090.wav|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_091.wav|It may well have been.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_092.wav|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_093.wav|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_094.wav|Last week, he was taken into hospital.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_095.wav|He seems to be pleased with the picture.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_096.wav|All options are open.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_097.wav|You will be.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_098.wav|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_099.wav|And rugby fans can help.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_100.wav|Now the system is right behind us.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_101.wav|However, it did not end that way.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_102.wav|This reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_103.wav|The group is due to report by the end of the year.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_104.wav|I love the Dome.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_105.wav|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_106.wav|The selection process is still at a very early stage.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_107.wav|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_108.wav|However, we have not come to any conclusions.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_109.wav|But it was a pleasure.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_110.wav|He takes the job.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_111.wav|It was an adventure.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_112.wav|That all hope is never lost.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_113.wav|And I thought - we have to do something with this.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_114.wav|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_115.wav|It is normal.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_116.wav|I was fighting for my life, I thought.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_117.wav|We need to handle it.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_118.wav|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_119.wav|It's a long process.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_120.wav|They were behind the wheel.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_121.wav|The fire was above the hole.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_122.wav|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_123.wav|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_124.wav|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_125.wav|I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_126.wav|I joined a group.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_127.wav|Does this mean.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_128.wav|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_129.wav|It is a job creation scheme.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_130.wav|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_131.wav|I'm so angry.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_132.wav|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_133.wav|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_134.wav|They keep the atmosphere in mind.|27,,,,

wav48/p254/p254_148.wav|There is a lack of chemistry.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_149.wav|This is the way things should be handled.|27,,,,

wav48/p254/p254_154.wav|You know the type.|27,,,,

wav48/p254/p254_156.wav|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_157.wav|I was in daily contact.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_158.wav|We will turn the corner.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_159.wav|This latter point is hugely important.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_160.wav|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_161.wav|It has been a lovely family occasion.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_162.wav|He's a nice guy.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_163.wav|It has to be now.|27,,,,

wav48/p254/p254_165.wav|I have got a wife to feed.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_166.wav|Tell it like it was?|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_167.wav|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.|27,,
wav48/p254/p254_168.wav|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_169.wav|We started to struggle with each other towards the end.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_170.wav|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_171.wav|He was a crazy man.|27,,,,

wav48/p254/p254_173.wav|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_174.wav|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_175.wav|It was a great achievement to win at Wembley.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_176.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.|27,,,,

wav48/p254/p254_183.wav|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_184.wav|However, this idea is never developed.|27,,,

wav48/p254/p254_186.wav|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_187.wav|Peace was won.|27,,,,

wav48/p254/p254_189.wav|I wanted to put myself on the line.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_190.wav|Off I went.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_191.wav|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_192.wav|Is that it?|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_193.wav|The conference is the first test.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_194.wav|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.|27,,,

wav48/p254/p254_201.wav|We have an election in eight days.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_202.wav|It's like a garage.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_203.wav|But I am a worried man.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_204.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_205.wav|That is an important part of our role.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_206.wav|It is a small part, and it's very small in the book.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_207.wav|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.|27,,
wav48/p254/p254_208.wav|I began to pray.|27,,,,

wav48/p254/p254_220.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_221.wav|Clearly, the stakes are high.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_222.wav|The boy is no longer with us.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_223.wav|The track is currently covered in snow.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_224.wav|They are the innocent victims.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_225.wav|It's so special.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_226.wav|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.|27,,
wav48/p254/p254_227.wav|At the time, he was a living legend.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_228.wav|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_229.wav|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_230.wav|They tried to give her advice.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_231.wav|And thought we would get away with it.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_232.wav|We were a load of rubbish.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_233.wav|They should come forward.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_234.wav|It is not the message alone.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_235.wav|He will make a statement on the dispute in the Commons tomorrow.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_236.wav|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_237.wav|It's a lovely, lovely film.|27,,,

wav48/p254/p254_239.wav|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_240.wav|My future is in the marathon.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_241.wav|They are all bright and different.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_242.wav|Chambers said he would accept the place.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_243.wav|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_244.wav|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_245.wav|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_246.wav|He got the same story.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_247.wav|Washington is consumed by the crisis.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_248.wav|I was shocked.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_249.wav|He's a lovely young man.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_250.wav|There's the mix.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_251.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_252.wav|This year I understood.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_253.wav|That could be in place by next year.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_254.wav|I was never going to play against Scotland.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_255.wav|It's a source of deep concern.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_256.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_257.wav|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_258.wav|The pensioners did not want to know.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_259.wav|It is also very valuable.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_260.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.|27,,,,

wav48/p254/p254_263.wav|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_264.wav|They want to shut the Scottish Office.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_265.wav|There is no link.|27,,,,

wav48/p254/p254_268.wav|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_269.wav|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_270.wav|It was an easy decision to come here.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_271.wav|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_272.wav|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_273.wav|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_275.wav|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.|27,,
wav48/p254/p254_276.wav|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.|27,,,

wav48/p254/p254_278.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_279.wav|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_280.wav|People have no choice.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_281.wav|If not, he should go home.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_282.wav|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_283.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_284.wav|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_285.wav|I saw it at a ruck.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_286.wav|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.|27,,
wav48/p254/p254_287.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_288.wav|He will address the nation this evening.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_289.wav|The mood is good.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_290.wav|It's like a high school play.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_291.wav|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_292.wav|This is a national crisis.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_293.wav|Well, he can do it.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_294.wav|These figures are truly awful.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_295.wav|That could change.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_296.wav|Who can predict?|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_297.wav|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_298.wav|One was a lawyer.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_299.wav|It is a road of death.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_300.wav|The plot is minimal.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_301.wav|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_302.wav|I did not name it.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_303.wav|We have waited a long time for this.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_304.wav|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.|27,,
wav48/p254/p254_305.wav|They were fantastic.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_306.wav|We are a peaceful people.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_307.wav|Craig is a major concern for us.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_308.wav|The problems began a long time ago.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_309.wav|My body is clearly capable.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_310.wav|It is out there.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_311.wav|He said she was mad.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_312.wav|In the old days, it was easy.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_313.wav|We are in the end game.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_314.wav|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_315.wav|It is a strong case.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_316.wav|The parents will have a great time, too.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_317.wav|Donald was his friend.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_318.wav|He was not a big name.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_319.wav|The police have to act to help them.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_320.wav|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_321.wav|The boat was fantastic.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_322.wav|It's not long enough.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_323.wav|My first concern is for the safety of the public.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_324.wav|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_326.wav|Finally, he paid for the movie.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_327.wav|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_329.wav|It would appear that it has not been a problem.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_330.wav|They haven't got a hope.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_331.wav|It has moved on in the last week.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_332.wav|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_333.wav|Today she has been released.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_334.wav|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_335.wav|It should be a great game, though.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_336.wav|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_337.wav|It should be scrapped.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_338.wav|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_339.wav|It was good for us that they lost that day.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_340.wav|They should take their mobile phones.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_341.wav|It is not like working for a living.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_342.wav|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_343.wav|It is long gone.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_344.wav|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_345.wav|Tell us about it.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_346.wav|It's all going to clear the debt.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_347.wav|That is a break with tradition.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_348.wav|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_349.wav|It was very formal.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_350.wav|I kept going for her.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_351.wav|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_352.wav|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_353.wav|No other job in world football can compare to this one.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_354.wav|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_355.wav|We will be homeless.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_356.wav|New Zealand rugby is totally different.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_357.wav|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_358.wav|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_359.wav|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_360.wav|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_361.wav|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_362.wav|The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_363.wav|There was no option.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_364.wav|It's now down in black and white.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_365.wav|Now, though, he has an incentive.|27,,
wav48/p254/p254_366.wav|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_367.wav|They received a reply from their own managers.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_368.wav|But I managed.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_369.wav|Five members were disciplined.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_370.wav|Talks are progressing.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_371.wav|They play together perfectly.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_372.wav|Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_373.wav|It's a record label, not a form of music.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_374.wav|It became a national network.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_375.wav|It is a large number.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_376.wav|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_377.wav|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_378.wav|He has the edge.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_379.wav|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.|27,,,
wav48/p254/p254_380.wav|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_381.wav|Face to face|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_382.wav|I am very happy with life.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_383.wav|I'm just enjoying every match.|27,,,,

wav48/p254/p254_388.wav|They really did a great job.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_389.wav|At the last I found a bunker.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_390.wav|Yet the data is compelling.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_391.wav|Perhaps the time has come to put the cup in a museum.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_392.wav|I would have loved to play in an Old Firm.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_393.wav|I'm pleased about one thing.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_394.wav|It is also claimed that he was murdered.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_395.wav|Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_396.wav|We're looking for justice.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_397.wav|I can lead by example.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_398.wav|Eriksson would have approved.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_399.wav|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_400.wav|It was a breathtaking moment.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_401.wav|It really is a gift to the world.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_402.wav|The car was just there.|27,,,,
wav48/p254/p254_403.wav|It was on fire.|27,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_001.wav|Please call Stella. |28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |28,,
wav48/p255/p255_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |28,,
wav48/p255/p255_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |28,,
wav48/p255/p255_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |28,,
wav48/p255/p255_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|28,,
wav48/p255/p255_025.wav|He has not been named.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_026.wav|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_027.wav|They should be so lucky.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_028.wav|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_029.wav|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.|28,,,,

wav48/p255/p255_032.wav|Then, suddenly, they weren't.|28,,

wav48/p255/p255_034.wav|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_035.wav|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.|28,,

wav48/p255/p255_051.wav|Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_052.wav|It's very odd.|28,,,,

wav48/p255/p255_062.wav|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_063.wav|We should have known.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_064.wav|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_065.wav|The end result is precisely the same.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_066.wav|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_067.wav|There is an element of racism in Scotland.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_068.wav|There could be a way back.|28,,,,

wav48/p255/p255_078.wav|Last week, he was taken into hospital.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_079.wav|He is driven.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_080.wav|Nothing is yet confirmed.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_081.wav|We have other options.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_082.wav|We want to know about the policy.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_083.wav|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.|28,,,,

wav48/p255/p255_088.wav|However, it did not end that way.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_089.wav|They've got to account for it.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_090.wav|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_091.wav|Until you hit the big games.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_092.wav|We could not get any possession.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_093.wav|If you could find it.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_094.wav|The selection process is still at a very early stage.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_095.wav|It is a delight on every level.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_096.wav|Get to know him.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_097.wav|May not have been at fault?|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_098.wav|I had a ball today.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_099.wav|Two of the team became ill.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_100.wav|That time is not now, however.|28,,,

wav48/p255/p255_108.wav|He was jailed for a year.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_109.wav|I came to complete.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_110.wav|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_111.wav|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_112.wav|Maybe this battle has been.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_113.wav|I'm delighted about that.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_114.wav|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_115.wav|I joined a group.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_116.wav|Does this mean.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_117.wav|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_118.wav|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.|28,,,,

wav48/p255/p255_126.wav|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.|28,,
wav48/p255/p255_127.wav|It will be too hot.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_128.wav|The role was perfect for Russell.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_129.wav|If not, a deal could take many months.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_130.wav|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_131.wav|Our intentions are real.|28,,,,

wav48/p255/p255_139.wav|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_140.wav|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_141.wav|We have got to get it right.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_142.wav|Wallace was a prisoner of war.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_143.wav|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_144.wav|Who would be right?|28,,,,

wav48/p255/p255_148.wav|The idea is simple.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_149.wav|It is like a football team.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_150.wav|It would be a last resort.|28,,,,

wav48/p255/p255_154.wav|We shall not be moved.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_155.wav|The weaknesses are few.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_156.wav|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_157.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.|28,,
wav48/p255/p255_158.wav|The first victory made a huge difference to my career.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_159.wav|There's a sense of excess in the novel.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_160.wav|Work has started.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_161.wav|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_162.wav|And sooner than we may think.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_163.wav|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_164.wav|It is so unfair.|28,,,,

wav48/p255/p255_167.wav|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_168.wav|We have to move forward.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_169.wav|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_170.wav|I lost my head.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_171.wav|That must be left to the Parole Board.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_172.wav|He is keen to stay in public service.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_173.wav|You are not going in blind.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_174.wav|They will do their own thing.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_175.wav|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_176.wav|You had to go and see him.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_177.wav|Waiting times for these services are too long.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_178.wav|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.|28,,,,

wav48/p255/p255_182.wav|We wanted it left for a wee while.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_183.wav|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_184.wav|And I saw the light!|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_185.wav|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_186.wav|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_187.wav|Tony had arrived.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_188.wav|It is the whole package.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_189.wav|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_190.wav|The goals were good.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_191.wav|There is no point in looking any further.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_192.wav|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_193.wav|Four policemen were wounded.|28,,,,

wav48/p255/p255_196.wav|They are now divorced.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_197.wav|I cannot say too much about them.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_198.wav|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_199.wav|However, this idea is never developed.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_200.wav|It is a farce.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_201.wav|I am totally surprised.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_202.wav|We must keep our feet on the ground.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_203.wav|However, he said the money had not been wasted.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_204.wav|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_205.wav|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_206.wav|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_207.wav|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_208.wav|It's just awful.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_209.wav|It's all about money, money, money.|28,,
wav48/p255/p255_210.wav|It was worth a photograph.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_211.wav|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_212.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_213.wav|We'll have to work hard today.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_214.wav|He knows a lot.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_215.wav|That is an important part of our role.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_216.wav|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_217.wav|I had relied on him.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_218.wav|I had decided to quit the show.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_219.wav|His third goal was superb.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_220.wav|It's been a good year.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_221.wav|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_222.wav|It's not ideal.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_223.wav|The FBI could become involved.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_224.wav|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_225.wav|The attacker has been put in foster care.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_226.wav|His death was a tragic accident.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_227.wav|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_228.wav|But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_229.wav|A career as a doctor is on hold.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_230.wav|During the communist time they were very privileged.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_231.wav|Mental health is a massive issue.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_232.wav|We played them off the pitch.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_233.wav|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_234.wav|Our numbers are small.|28,,,,

wav48/p255/p255_238.wav|At the time, he was a living legend.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_239.wav|It's the same as Glasgow.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_240.wav|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_241.wav|It is mainstream.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_242.wav|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_243.wav|We were awful.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_244.wav|They had no children.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_245.wav|It is set in Paris.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_246.wav|It is not the message alone.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_247.wav|It's quite a line-up!|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_248.wav|It has been declared.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_249.wav|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_250.wav|We have a free vote on these things in our party.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_251.wav|It would appear that it has not been a problem.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_252.wav|It's only fair.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_253.wav|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_254.wav|Chambers said he would accept the place.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_255.wav|His body was never found.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_256.wav|There's the mix.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_257.wav|We need to move away from the culture of long hours.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_258.wav|I can't get a job.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_259.wav|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.|28,,
wav48/p255/p255_260.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_261.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_262.wav|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_263.wav|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_264.wav|I am very angry.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_265.wav|They must play for each other.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_266.wav|He can do everything.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_267.wav|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_268.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.|28,,,,

wav48/p255/p255_273.wav|This is a question of Islam.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_274.wav|It looks as though he will be right.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_275.wav|He was popular.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_276.wav|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_277.wav|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_278.wav|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_279.wav|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_280.wav|One knows the feeling.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_281.wav|He promised to lead from the front in battle for entry.|28,,,,

wav48/p255/p255_284.wav|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_285.wav|This is a national crisis.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_286.wav|The death toll included five children.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_287.wav|My body is clearly capable.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_288.wav|So I did.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_289.wav|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_290.wav|She said she could not believe that they had run away.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_292.wav|These figures are truly awful.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_293.wav|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_294.wav|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_295.wav|Who can predict?|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_296.wav|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_297.wav|A new school will be built.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_298.wav|I have tonight resigned as member of the European Commission.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_299.wav|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_300.wav|Graeme was prepared.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_301.wav|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_302.wav|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_303.wav|Our task is to complete the picture.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_304.wav|they fail to engage.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_305.wav|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_306.wav|The company yesterday refused to comment.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_307.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_308.wav|It's certainly different.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_309.wav|Is there on his hands?|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_310.wav|We have got no money to go anywhere.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_311.wav|It's about my time as a guitarist.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_312.wav|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_313.wav|I never thought it would take this long.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_314.wav|In fact, they have the opposite effect.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_315.wav|The election is total confusion and chaos.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_316.wav|Henman has been warned.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_317.wav|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_318.wav|I asked for a positive response and I was given one.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_319.wav|For the moment, our position remains the same.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_320.wav|Referees are easy targets.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_321.wav|There was some merit in that.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_322.wav|I came into this world with nothing.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_323.wav|That's the law of the land.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_324.wav|They will be destroyed.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_325.wav|It is a strong case.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_326.wav|My view has now completely changed.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_327.wav|The police have to act to help them.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_328.wav|We agreed to disagree.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_329.wav|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_330.wav|It could have gone either way.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_331.wav|It is a time bomb.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_332.wav|I'd like to take the plunge.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_333.wav|It can be halted.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_334.wav|Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_335.wav|They haven't got a hope.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_336.wav|Gaelic provision continued to be good.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_337.wav|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_338.wav|The Scottish Prison Service said it could not comment on the visit.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_339.wav|Today, we begin to answer that question.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_340.wav|Look at the witnesses.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_341.wav|Nobody else was with me.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_342.wav|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_343.wav|That is the very reason why it was so vital.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_344.wav|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_345.wav|This is a friendly match?|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_346.wav|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_347.wav|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_348.wav|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_349.wav|That is a break with tradition.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_350.wav|I kept going for her.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_351.wav|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_352.wav|He's very explosive.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_353.wav|I was in the train station overnight.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_354.wav|It benefits the whole family.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_355.wav|It was one in the afternoon.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_356.wav|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_357.wav|We will be homeless.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_358.wav|It was fit for royalty.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_359.wav|We are looking for perfection.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_360.wav|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_361.wav|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_362.wav|I have got a wife to feed.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_363.wav|I wanted to help the poor people in Edinburgh.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_364.wav|Not so, it seems.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_365.wav|Tell it like it was?|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_366.wav|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_367.wav|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_368.wav|He put some colour into Scottish history.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_369.wav|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_370.wav|They received a reply from their own managers.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_371.wav|By that time, however, it was already too late.|28,,
wav48/p255/p255_372.wav|Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_373.wav|It's a long process.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_374.wav|Not because they want to sing about something.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_375.wav|He could not be contacted for further comment yesterday.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_376.wav|Colour was at the core of his life.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_377.wav|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.|28,,
wav48/p255/p255_378.wav|It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_379.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.|28,,,
wav48/p255/p255_380.wav|The casualties were not named.|28,,,,
wav48/p255/p255_381.wav|I looked again at its vision for a Scottish Parliament.|28,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_001.wav|Please call Stella. |29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |29,,
wav48/p256/p256_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |29,,,
wav48/p256/p256_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |29,,,
wav48/p256/p256_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |29,,
wav48/p256/p256_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |29,,
wav48/p256/p256_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |29,,,
wav48/p256/p256_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |29,,,
wav48/p256/p256_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |29,,,
wav48/p256/p256_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |29,,,
wav48/p256/p256_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |29,,
wav48/p256/p256_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|29,,
wav48/p256/p256_025.wav|It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_026.wav|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.|29,,,
wav48/p256/p256_027.wav|I have a theory.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_028.wav|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_029.wav|There's a story, too.|29,,,
wav48/p256/p256_030.wav|I was an athlete.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_031.wav|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_032.wav|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_033.wav|Then, suddenly, they weren't.|29,,
wav48/p256/p256_034.wav|A web site is planned for November.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_035.wav|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_036.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_037.wav|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.|29,,,
wav48/p256/p256_038.wav|They're just different.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_039.wav|It's a real threat.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_040.wav|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.|29,,
wav48/p256/p256_041.wav|It had been played at festivals.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_042.wav|Indeed, he does.|29,,,
wav48/p256/p256_043.wav|She is believed to be in South Africa.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_044.wav|This film will be totally awesome.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_045.wav|No meaningful response was issued.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_046.wav|That period was a struggle.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_047.wav|A neighbour said.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_048.wav|It's a crucial award.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_049.wav|It is difficult for Ali.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_050.wav|It's a blessing.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_051.wav|Is a drug dealer?|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_052.wav|It has been a horrible, horrible time.|29,,,
wav48/p256/p256_053.wav|I would love to have him home.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_054.wav|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_055.wav|He had no enemies.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_056.wav|Sadly, it can't.|29,,,
wav48/p256/p256_057.wav|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_058.wav|It is unique.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_059.wav|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_060.wav|That's the truth.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_061.wav|That is very hard, alone.|29,,,
wav48/p256/p256_062.wav|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.|29,,,
wav48/p256/p256_063.wav|The problems are a result of that shortfall.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_064.wav|And a film maker was born.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_065.wav|It's a matter of balance.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_066.wav|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_067.wav|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_068.wav|They may yet have the last laugh.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_069.wav|There was a battle there.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_070.wav|They are real.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_071.wav|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_072.wav|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.|29,,,
wav48/p256/p256_073.wav|It should be devolved.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_074.wav|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_075.wav|I was as strong as a horse.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_076.wav|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.|29,,
wav48/p256/p256_077.wav|The girls are so lucky to be alive.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_078.wav|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.|29,,,
wav48/p256/p256_079.wav|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_080.wav|It is a terrible place.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_081.wav|I've got the shirt.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_082.wav|This is the way things should be handled.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_083.wav|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.|29,,,
wav48/p256/p256_084.wav|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_085.wav|It may well have been.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_086.wav|I first met him last summer.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_087.wav|Last week, he was taken into hospital.|29,,,
wav48/p256/p256_088.wav|He seems to be pleased with the picture.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_089.wav|It's never too late.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_090.wav|It was nice.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_091.wav|We do not get that impression now.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_092.wav|The city council is a major property owner in the area.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_093.wav|That will come after the game on Saturday.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_094.wav|A council spokesman said that they could not comment on the issue.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_095.wav|We must look forward.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_096.wav|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_097.wav|They've got to account for it.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_098.wav|She told The Herald.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_099.wav|It was clear.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_100.wav|There was no rescue.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_101.wav|We could not get any possession.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_102.wav|They are now divorced.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_103.wav|The court heard he drove into the path of a car.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_104.wav|Journalists should make him.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_105.wav|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.|29,,,
wav48/p256/p256_106.wav|Get to know him.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_107.wav|But it was a pleasure.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_108.wav|We have every respect for Michelle.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_109.wav|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_110.wav|I didn't play well last year.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_111.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_112.wav|They will want to perform well.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_113.wav|It's not perfect.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_114.wav|It was the eighties.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_115.wav|They were behind the wheel.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_116.wav|This is a step backwards.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_117.wav|It was ugly.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_118.wav|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_119.wav|I joined a group.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_120.wav|It is rubbish.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_121.wav|Who would be a referee?|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_122.wav|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_123.wav|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.|29,,
wav48/p256/p256_124.wav|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_125.wav|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_126.wav|There were no grounds for his action.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_127.wav|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_128.wav|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_129.wav|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_130.wav|They keep the atmosphere in mind.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_131.wav|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_132.wav|Well, you can have a tree.|29,,,
wav48/p256/p256_133.wav|Who will attend?|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_134.wav|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_135.wav|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_136.wav|Our intentions are real.|29,,,,

wav48/p256/p256_241.wav|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.|29,,,,

wav48/p256/p256_249.wav|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.|29,,,
wav48/p256/p256_250.wav|It was a hit.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_251.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_252.wav|Her presence was almost everywhere.|29,,,,

wav48/p256/p256_254.wav|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.|29,,,
wav48/p256/p256_255.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.|29,,,
wav48/p256/p256_256.wav|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_257.wav|Chelsea was a great club.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_258.wav|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_259.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.|29,,,,

wav48/p256/p256_268.wav|It looks as though he will be right.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_269.wav|Of course, that is not the whole story.|29,,,
wav48/p256/p256_270.wav|He has not created a Festival resource.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_271.wav|Frankly, we should all have such problems.|29,,,

wav48/p256/p256_280.wav|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.|29,,,
wav48/p256/p256_281.wav|But I've won both ways.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_282.wav|I saw it at a ruck.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_283.wav|The attacker died in the crash.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_284.wav|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_285.wav|It's like a high school play.|29,,,,

wav48/p256/p256_287.wav|It's very safe.|29,,,,

wav48/p256/p256_289.wav|She said she could not believe that they had run away.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_290.wav|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_291.wav|He wrote the letter two days before he died.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_292.wav|The results are sometimes contentious.|29,,,,

wav48/p256/p256_310.wav|We have waited a long time for this.|29,,,,
wav48/p256/p256_311.wav|This is the culture change in medicine.|29,,,,

wav48/p256/p256_313.wav|This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.|29,,,,

wav48/p257/p257_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |30,,
wav48/p257/p257_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |30,,
wav48/p257/p257_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |30,,
wav48/p257/p257_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|30,,
wav48/p257/p257_025.wav|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_026.wav|Is this accurate?|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_027.wav|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_028.wav|Because we do not need it.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_029.wav|Life was like a timetable.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_030.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.|30,,,,

wav48/p257/p257_052.wav|But the law is very clear on this.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_053.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.|30,,
wav48/p257/p257_054.wav|We were surprised to see the photograph.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_055.wav|Next league matches Celtic.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_056.wav|It's very odd.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_057.wav|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_058.wav|It is not great art.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_059.wav|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_060.wav|There was a battle there.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_061.wav|Scotland had great assets.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_062.wav|There will be tough opponents to this report.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_063.wav|Have a look at our accounts.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_064.wav|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_065.wav|There is an element of racism in Scotland.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_066.wav|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_067.wav|It's all I can do.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_068.wav|There could be a way back.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_069.wav|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_070.wav|The price cuts are really exciting.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_071.wav|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.|30,,
wav48/p257/p257_072.wav|I had my suspicions.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_073.wav|She died in hospital two hours later.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_074.wav|It was chaotic.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_075.wav|Is there a new way forward?|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_076.wav|I've not thought about it.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_077.wav|People must remain vigilant.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_078.wav|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_079.wav|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_080.wav|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_081.wav|It may well have been.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_082.wav|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_083.wav|He seems to be pleased with the picture.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_084.wav|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_085.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.|30,,
wav48/p257/p257_086.wav|It's never too late.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_087.wav|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_088.wav|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_089.wav|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_090.wav|Today I couldn't run on it.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_091.wav|We must look forward.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_092.wav|It is an old family habit.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_093.wav|He was possessed|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_094.wav|She told The Herald.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_095.wav|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.|30,,
wav48/p257/p257_096.wav|The peace process will be buried!|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_097.wav|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_098.wav|They are now divorced.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_099.wav|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_100.wav|It was mayhem.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_101.wav|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_102.wav|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_103.wav|We have every respect for Michelle.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_104.wav|That time is not now, however.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_105.wav|I didn't play well last year.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_106.wav|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_107.wav|They will want to perform well.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_108.wav|They had to be cut from the wreckage.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_109.wav|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_110.wav|It is normal.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_111.wav|I was fighting for my life, I thought.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_112.wav|I don't have many friends.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_113.wav|It's a shame.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_114.wav|It was the eighties.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_115.wav|We do not expect any surplus.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_116.wav|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_117.wav|It's not a new concept in jazz.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_118.wav|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_119.wav|I'm delighted about that.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_120.wav|Does this mean.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_121.wav|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_122.wav|He did his job.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_123.wav|You can spend money on housing.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_124.wav|That's all right then.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_125.wav|I was furious.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_126.wav|It has removed a bit of guilt.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_127.wav|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_128.wav|It's terrible that he has died the same way.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_129.wav|So the European elections are extremely important.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_130.wav|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_131.wav|Who will attend?|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_132.wav|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_133.wav|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_134.wav|I am now unemployed.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_135.wav|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_136.wav|They made such decisions in London.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_137.wav|Our intentions are real.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_138.wav|It is also well received.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_139.wav|What will happen then?|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_140.wav|It's not true.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_141.wav|I feel very grateful with everything.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_142.wav|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_143.wav|Nobody in the world can get away from him.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_144.wav|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_145.wav|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_146.wav|There is a lack of chemistry.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_147.wav|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_148.wav|It is like a football team.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_149.wav|That group reported just before Christmas.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_150.wav|He will emerge as a world leader.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_151.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_152.wav|They did very well.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_153.wav|It became a book by itself.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_154.wav|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_155.wav|The weather forecast isn't good.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_156.wav|There's a sense of excess in the novel.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_157.wav|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_158.wav|There's a pause.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_159.wav|He can do no wrong.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_160.wav|It was so new, so exciting.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_161.wav|I've learned from my mistakes.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_162.wav|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_163.wav|I've put my own money into this project.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_164.wav|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_165.wav|I lost my head.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_166.wav|You are not going in blind.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_167.wav|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_168.wav|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_169.wav|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_170.wav|My life has been destroyed.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_171.wav|There was no hint of scandal.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_172.wav|Treatment is not an issue with these people.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_173.wav|I feel like my game has come a long way.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_174.wav|We wanted it left for a wee while.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_175.wav|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_176.wav|It's quite a routine.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_177.wav|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_178.wav|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_179.wav|Everyone can be bought.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_180.wav|It is minute.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_181.wav|They need to look after themselves.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_182.wav|What has caused the demise of singing?|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_183.wav|One was a lawyer.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_184.wav|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_185.wav|It was an odd affair, in many respects.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_186.wav|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_187.wav|Saturday is gone.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_188.wav|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_189.wav|Last night was a key episode.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_190.wav|We must keep our feet on the ground.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_191.wav|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_192.wav|Off I went.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_193.wav|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_194.wav|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_195.wav|Ferguson should take note.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_196.wav|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_197.wav|It's just awful.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_198.wav|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_199.wav|IT S all in the hair.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_200.wav|We have an election in eight days.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_201.wav|But I am a worried man.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_202.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_203.wav|Saddam Hussein is a devil.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_204.wav|He knows a lot.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_205.wav|He is slightly confused.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_206.wav|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_207.wav|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.|30,,
wav48/p257/p257_208.wav|I am delighted for Simon.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_209.wav|It had all been arranged.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_210.wav|A Grampian Police spokesman said.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_211.wav|We have got to get it right.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_212.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_213.wav|I might come back.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_214.wav|His death was a tragic accident.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_215.wav|It's just a place to open it.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_216.wav|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_217.wav|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_218.wav|William Hague delighted his party.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_219.wav|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_220.wav|We played them off the pitch.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_221.wav|She really suffered for her art.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_222.wav|He demanded to speak to the boss.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_223.wav|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.|30,,
wav48/p257/p257_224.wav|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_225.wav|I think he's the favourite, no question.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_226.wav|Broke the birdie record.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_227.wav|They had no children.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_228.wav|It is set in Paris.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_229.wav|Well, they were the unlucky ones.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_230.wav|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_231.wav|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_232.wav|John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, will fly to the summit tomorrow.|30,,
wav48/p257/p257_233.wav|But it's a subtle process.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_234.wav|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_235.wav|My future is in the marathon.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_236.wav|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_237.wav|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_238.wav|They may yet have the last laugh.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_239.wav|You can feel at home in China.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_240.wav|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_241.wav|I should think so, too.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_242.wav|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_243.wav|I didn't need to watch it on the video.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_244.wav|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_245.wav|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_246.wav|We need to move away from the culture of long hours.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_247.wav|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_248.wav|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.|30,,
wav48/p257/p257_249.wav|I watched a game.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_250.wav|They are interior designers and architects.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_251.wav|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_252.wav|they fail to engage.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_253.wav|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_254.wav|I would have the hammer in the crowd.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_255.wav|He thought he had a month to cross the street.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_256.wav|He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_257.wav|Blood samples were taken.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_258.wav|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_259.wav|It's very nice.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_260.wav|Frankly, we should all have such problems.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_261.wav|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_262.wav|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_263.wav|And Michael was just great.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_264.wav|We're in shock.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_265.wav|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_266.wav|Our objective is to tackle poverty.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_267.wav|One knows the feeling.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_268.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_269.wav|She looked so young.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_270.wav|It was a privilege to work for him.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_271.wav|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_272.wav|He looked very sharp.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_273.wav|You've got to have both sides.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_274.wav|Who did the recruiting?|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_275.wav|Police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_276.wav|Well, he can do it.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_277.wav|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_278.wav|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_279.wav|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_280.wav|The results are sometimes contentious.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_281.wav|He should have won.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_282.wav|A new school will be built.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_283.wav|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_284.wav|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_285.wav|What has altered?|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_286.wav|The home was now under new management.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_287.wav|Graeme was prepared.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_288.wav|I thought it was my only chance.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_289.wav|However, the snow was welcomed by some.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_290.wav|It just came into my head that day.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_291.wav|They are wrong.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_292.wav|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_293.wav|It's just not funny!|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_294.wav|I am very happy to be here.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_295.wav|The plot is minimal.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_296.wav|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_297.wav|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_298.wav|This is the culture change in medicine.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_299.wav|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_300.wav|They were fantastic.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_301.wav|I never thought it would take this long.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_302.wav|In fact, they have the opposite effect.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_303.wav|They wanted the club to make money.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_304.wav|Kids are terrible.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_305.wav|Henman has been warned.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_306.wav|It should be equal.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_307.wav|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_308.wav|The home team had an amazing start.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_309.wav|It is out there.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_310.wav|They had a confession.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_311.wav|Davis is very supportive, as a director.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_312.wav|We are in the end game.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_313.wav|I came into this world with nothing.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_314.wav|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_315.wav|I am so upset.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_316.wav|The boat was fantastic.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_317.wav|I saw some good things.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_318.wav|Finally, he paid for the movie.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_319.wav|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_320.wav|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_321.wav|Three years ago he would have been.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_322.wav|You feel the pride.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_323.wav|It is so unfair.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_324.wav|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_325.wav|Indeed, it was magical.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_326.wav|I've got no secret.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_327.wav|Look at the witnesses.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_328.wav|I'm very lucky.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_329.wav|We must do something.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_330.wav|He says that he is no different from any other man.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_331.wav|Alex Ferguson is the same.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_332.wav|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_333.wav|Like his acting, it was an accident.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_334.wav|It is not like working for a living.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_335.wav|It is long gone.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_336.wav|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_337.wav|Tell us about it.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_338.wav|The salary changes are long overdue.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_339.wav|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_340.wav|It was very formal.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_341.wav|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_342.wav|Tyson is overwhelmed.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_343.wav|We are delighted at the response from potential employers.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_344.wav|I wanted to go out on a high.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_345.wav|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_346.wav|I felt really good until Friday.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_347.wav|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_348.wav|He could face a jail sentence.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_349.wav|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_350.wav|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_351.wav|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_352.wav|Then followed a bout of flu.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_353.wav|There is no signature.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_354.wav|It's a long process.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_355.wav|It is a large number.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_356.wav|He knew his job inside out.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_357.wav|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_358.wav|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_359.wav|It does not even have a staff shortage.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_360.wav|I haven't had a kick at a Celtic player for a while.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_361.wav|He has the edge.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_362.wav|He denied the charge.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_363.wav|There were no casualties.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_364.wav|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_365.wav|YOU thought it was a headache.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_366.wav|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_367.wav|A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_368.wav|They really did a great job.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_369.wav|There is a solution, she believes.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_370.wav|However, it's good to turn the page.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_371.wav|This year I understood.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_372.wav|I'm pleased about one thing.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_373.wav|It is unusual.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_374.wav|It is also claimed that he was murdered.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_375.wav|It is likely the rest of the market will follow suit.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_376.wav|I can lead by example.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_377.wav|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.|30,,
wav48/p257/p257_378.wav|They are good.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_379.wav|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_380.wav|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_381.wav|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.|30,,
wav48/p257/p257_382.wav|It was on fire.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_383.wav|The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_384.wav|I never won a penny throughout my career.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_385.wav|Emotions were complex.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_386.wav|He's already made history.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_387.wav|So I did.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_388.wav|You ask the question.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_389.wav|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_390.wav|There was no trouble.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_391.wav|This is a huge confidence boost.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_392.wav|Not because they want to sing about something.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_393.wav|It is not a standing army.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_394.wav|We haven't had any adverse reaction to the project.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_395.wav|I believe the gap is nearly there.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_396.wav|You wanted the evidence.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_397.wav|Our numbers are small.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_398.wav|I was very young.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_399.wav|We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_400.wav|I am the Son of Sam.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_401.wav|She is superb.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_402.wav|Today, he is in the same position as four years ago.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_403.wav|It doesn't always work that way.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_404.wav|It is simple, but profound.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_405.wav|No preference emerged.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_406.wav|But they are still unlikely to be involved in combat.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_407.wav|I've invented a village in East Lothian.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_408.wav|She has reached the top of her profession.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_409.wav|It goes with the job.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_410.wav|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_411.wav|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.|30,,
wav48/p257/p257_412.wav|I recommend a tour.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_413.wav|We are delighted with this outcome.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_414.wav|I have so much respect for him.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_415.wav|We shall be victorious.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_416.wav|Rather than answer, she resigned.|30,,,
wav48/p257/p257_417.wav|War is not the action.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_418.wav|They said so that I would look good in uniform.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_419.wav|It's not about defining styles.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_420.wav|One must hope not!|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_421.wav|It is marvellous.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_422.wav|But it may take some time to confirm the findings.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_423.wav|They should not be blamed for it.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_424.wav|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.|30,,
wav48/p257/p257_425.wav|It is bizarre.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_426.wav|Mary Archer is almost too clever.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_427.wav|I was just overwhelmed.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_428.wav|It had been in place since last July.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_429.wav|It's a miracle.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_430.wav|The first minister is obviously concerned to hear about this incident.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_431.wav|That was the first time I worked with Richard.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_432.wav|They will form a tribute.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_433.wav|The whole region is in shock.|30,,,,
wav48/p257/p257_434.wav|The bill would be massive.|30,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_001.wav|Please call Stella. |31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |31,,
wav48/p258/p258_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |31,,,
wav48/p258/p258_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |31,,,
wav48/p258/p258_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |31,,
wav48/p258/p258_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |31,,
wav48/p258/p258_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |31,,,
wav48/p258/p258_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |31,,,
wav48/p258/p258_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |31,,,
wav48/p258/p258_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |31,,,
wav48/p258/p258_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |31,,
wav48/p258/p258_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|31,,
wav48/p258/p258_025.wav|Johnson was pretty low.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_026.wav|It's nice to hear.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_027.wav|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_028.wav|They should be so lucky.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_029.wav|Because it's a waste of time for both sides.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_030.wav|However, the following year the cancer returned.|31,,,
wav48/p258/p258_031.wav|Because we do not need it.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_032.wav|He took me on a tour of the wards.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_033.wav|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_034.wav|I'd like to continue that record.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_035.wav|It was clear.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_036.wav|It is not for any other purpose.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_037.wav|President Bush is at war.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_038.wav|I was scared.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_039.wav|It will come all right.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_040.wav|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_041.wav|The judge said.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_042.wav|We need to chat.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_043.wav|It's a blessing.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_044.wav|As she explains.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_045.wav|She looked so young.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_046.wav|He looks like an Afghan.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_047.wav|It is the whole package.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_048.wav|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.|31,,,
wav48/p258/p258_049.wav|We were surprised to see the photograph.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_050.wav|That's the day job.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_051.wav|We have not given up hope.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_052.wav|You must have a government and a good civil service.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_053.wav|That is very hard, alone.|31,,,
wav48/p258/p258_054.wav|It's that kind of place.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_055.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.|31,,,
wav48/p258/p258_056.wav|And if he hadn't become a musician?|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_057.wav|He was popular.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_058.wav|It should be devolved.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_059.wav|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_060.wav|Try to save us.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_061.wav|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_062.wav|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_063.wav|There is an element of racism in Scotland.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_064.wav|That was the easy election.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_065.wav|It's all I can do.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_066.wav|The price cuts are really exciting.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_067.wav|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.|31,,
wav48/p258/p258_068.wav|The girls are so lucky to be alive.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_069.wav|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_070.wav|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.|31,,
wav48/p258/p258_071.wav|He got the same story.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_072.wav|This is the way things should be handled.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_073.wav|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.|31,,,
wav48/p258/p258_074.wav|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_075.wav|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.|31,,,
wav48/p258/p258_076.wav|I first met him last summer.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_077.wav|Last week, he was taken into hospital.|31,,,
wav48/p258/p258_078.wav|Nothing is yet confirmed.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_079.wav|New Zealand rugby is totally different.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_080.wav|We have other options.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_081.wav|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_082.wav|The city council is a major property owner in the area.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_083.wav|Today I couldn't run on it.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_084.wav|They are different types.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_085.wav|It is a simple equation.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_086.wav|Until you hit the big games.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_087.wav|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.|31,,
wav48/p258/p258_088.wav|There was no rescue.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_089.wav|She's got to say something.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_090.wav|The selection process is still at a very early stage.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_091.wav|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_092.wav|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.|31,,,,
wav48/p258/p258_093.wav|Journalists should make him.|31,,,,

wav48/p259/p259_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. )|32,,,
wav48/p259/p259_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. )|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. )|32,,
wav48/p259/p259_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. )|32,,
wav48/p259/p259_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. )|32,,,
wav48/p259/p259_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. )|32,,,
wav48/p259/p259_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. )|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. )|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. )|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. )|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. )|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. )|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. )|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. )|32,,,
wav48/p259/p259_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. )|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. )|32,,,
wav48/p259/p259_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. )|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. )|32,,
wav48/p259/p259_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.)|32,,
wav48/p259/p259_025.wav|But it could prove disastrous.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_026.wav|Smoking is also very important.)|32,,,,

wav48/p259/p259_395.wav|After the match, do you ?)|32,,,
wav48/p259/p259_396.wav|That is a crazy situation.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_397.wav|We are really good friends.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_398.wav|The principle is quite clear.)|32,,,,

wav48/p259/p259_403.wav|It would be quite nice.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_404.wav|This remains the party's policy.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_405.wav|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.)|32,,,
wav48/p259/p259_406.wav|The parties include the Scottish Executive.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_407.wav|We will win the argument.)|32,,,,

wav48/p259/p259_412.wav|It sounds like a wish list.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_413.wav|The director will be present.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_414.wav|It is the nature of his party.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_415.wav|Theatre is not a museum.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_416.wav|We have very limited capacity.)|32,,,,

wav48/p259/p259_418.wav|My view has now completely changed.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_419.wav|I had a fortunate war.)|32,,,,

wav48/p259/p259_425.wav|It is hard to understand.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_426.wav|But the foundations have been laid.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_427.wav|There was an element of frustration.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_428.wav|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.)|32,,,
wav48/p259/p259_429.wav|The casualties were not named.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_430.wav|The next few months will tell.)|32,,,,

wav48/p259/p259_443.wav|My aim is a top six finish.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_444.wav|It means an enormous amount.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_445.wav|Such an attack is bizarre.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_446.wav|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.)|32,,,
wav48/p259/p259_447.wav|I never had a childhood.)|32,,,,

wav48/p259/p259_449.wav|None of the pieces was commissioned.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_450.wav|There is another important factor.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_451.wav|I never found my rhythm.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_452.wav|In fact, the reasons are simple.)|32,,,
wav48/p259/p259_453.wav|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_454.wav|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_455.wav|Nobody has told the story.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_456.wav|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.)|32,,,

wav48/p259/p259_460.wav|It is pretty bad news.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_461.wav|It certainly appeared that way.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_462.wav|We put our bid in last night.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_463.wav|Quality was high in all sections.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_464.wav|It could cause a little bit of disruption.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_465.wav|But we have built a platform for next season.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_466.wav|I think the goalkeeper should have gone.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_467.wav|They offer a kind of narrative.)|32,,,,

wav48/p259/p259_470.wav|They were good years for him.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_471.wav|Let that be their memorial.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_472.wav|Then came the farewell to Europe.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_473.wav|I'm very passionate about my country.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_474.wav|Phil Mickelson did that last year.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_475.wav|There was no trouble at all.)|32,,,,

wav48/p259/p259_478.wav|You have to have a proven track record to get them.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_479.wav|Some problems were too complex.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_480.wav|Their one weakness was running between the wickets.)|32,,,,
wav48/p259/p259_481.wav|The chief constable has retired.)|32,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_001.wav|Please call Stella. |33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |33,,
wav48/p260/p260_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |33,,
wav48/p260/p260_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |33,,
wav48/p260/p260_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |33,,
wav48/p260/p260_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|33,,
wav48/p260/p260_025.wav|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_026.wav|We will be homeless.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_027.wav|Is this accurate?|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_028.wav|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.|33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_029.wav|They have no history.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_030.wav|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|33,,
wav48/p260/p260_031.wav|I'd just like to play.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_032.wav|There's a story, too.|33,,,

wav48/p260/p260_034.wav|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_035.wav|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_036.wav|Then, suddenly, they weren't.|33,,
wav48/p260/p260_037.wav|It's a fact.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_038.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_039.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.|33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_040.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.|33,,
wav48/p260/p260_041.wav|Dancing was her life.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_042.wav|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_043.wav|We will push.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_044.wav|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_045.wav|Among them are many criminals.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_046.wav|It is marvellous.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_047.wav|Every aspect of our play was first class.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_048.wav|Our people are ready.|33,,,,

wav48/p260/p260_050.wav|Her body was found about four miles from the car.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_051.wav|I was inspired by two things.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_052.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.|33,,
wav48/p260/p260_053.wav|My fitness was very poor.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_054.wav|Sadly, it can't.|33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_055.wav|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_056.wav|I expect a rapid response.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_057.wav|What was the main difference?|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_058.wav|There's a danger.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_059.wav|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_060.wav|Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_061.wav|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_062.wav|It's that kind of place.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_063.wav|They are real.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_064.wav|I've spent a lot of time on buses.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_065.wav|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.|33,,
wav48/p260/p260_066.wav|And if he hadn't become a musician?|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_067.wav|That was a gold medal for certain.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_068.wav|We should have known.|33,,,,

wav48/p260/p260_082.wav|He seems to be pleased with the picture.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_083.wav|By then, he was walking on water.|33,,,

wav48/p260/p260_092.wav|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_093.wav|Then came the crunch.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_094.wav|It is annoying.|33,,,,

wav48/p260/p260_100.wav|May not have been at fault?|33,,,,

wav48/p260/p260_142.wav|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.|33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_143.wav|It is not just about pay.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_144.wav|Note the date.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_145.wav|So I got a blood test.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_146.wav|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_147.wav|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.|33,,,,

wav48/p260/p260_162.wav|They are not advertised.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_163.wav|Seven people were later detained by police.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_164.wav|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.|33,,
wav48/p260/p260_165.wav|Again, we were lucky.|33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_166.wav|They will do their own thing.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_167.wav|Does that put pressure on us?|33,,,,

wav48/p260/p260_169.wav|Is Saddam a threat?|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_170.wav|As we worked.|33,,,,

wav48/p260/p260_183.wav|Our team is just so young.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_184.wav|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.|33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_185.wav|It is a farce.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_186.wav|Peace was won.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_187.wav|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.|33,,
wav48/p260/p260_188.wav|I came home by ambulance.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_189.wav|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_190.wav|Is that success?|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_191.wav|They are ready.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_192.wav|I have a cold.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_193.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_194.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.|33,,
wav48/p260/p260_195.wav|It's all about money, money, money.|33,,
wav48/p260/p260_196.wav|There was no safety net.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_197.wav|It was worth a photograph.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_198.wav|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_199.wav|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.|33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_200.wav|There was an e-mail.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_201.wav|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_202.wav|I am delighted for Simon.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_203.wav|It had all been arranged.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_204.wav|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_205.wav|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.|33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_206.wav|It's not ideal.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_207.wav|In each case they were a goal down.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_208.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.|33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_209.wav|I might come back.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_210.wav|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_211.wav|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_212.wav|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.|33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_213.wav|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_214.wav|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_215.wav|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_216.wav|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_217.wav|It's a question of creating a future awareness.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_218.wav|It's not before time.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_219.wav|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.|33,,,,

wav48/p260/p260_223.wav|My wife and family are the support system.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_224.wav|The move was also welcomed by the National Union of Journalists.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_225.wav|We were awful.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_226.wav|They tried to give her advice.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_227.wav|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.|33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_228.wav|The parties have been given until today to respond.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_229.wav|There is no excuse.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_230.wav|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.|33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_231.wav|But it's a subtle process.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_232.wav|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_233.wav|The car was just there.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_234.wav|The whole thing will be great.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_235.wav|Our policy is clear.|33,,,,

wav48/p260/p260_237.wav|You can feel at home in China.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_238.wav|The scene is about this?|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_239.wav|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_240.wav|It was a kind of contempt.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_241.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.|33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_242.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.|33,,
wav48/p260/p260_243.wav|I should think so, too.|33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_244.wav|It was a hit.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_245.wav|There's the mix.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_246.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_247.wav|Is there on his hands?|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_248.wav|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.|33,,
wav48/p260/p260_249.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.|33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_250.wav|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.|33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_251.wav|Chelsea was a great club.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_252.wav|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_253.wav|We have to expand.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_254.wav|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_255.wav|Is that a serious question?|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_256.wav|They must play for each other.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_257.wav|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.|33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_258.wav|There's not much money in cycling.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_259.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_260.wav|I am just trying to do my job.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_261.wav|This is a question of Islam.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_262.wav|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_263.wav|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.|33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_264.wav|Frankly, we should all have such problems.|33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_265.wav|The system can work.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_266.wav|We're in shock.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_267.wav|Our objective is to tackle poverty.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_268.wav|It's a way of life.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_269.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.|33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_270.wav|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.|33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_271.wav|They seem to get away with it.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_272.wav|She looked so young.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_273.wav|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_274.wav|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_275.wav|If not, he should go home.|33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_276.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.|33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_277.wav|We are a grandmother.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_278.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_279.wav|You feel very helpless.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_280.wav|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.|33,,
wav48/p260/p260_281.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_282.wav|He will address the nation this evening.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_283.wav|They have shown a great desire and attitude.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_284.wav|Maloney is an engaging talent.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_285.wav|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_286.wav|This is a national crisis.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_287.wav|Bombing slaughter rejected|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_288.wav|We are not going to forget.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_289.wav|No Briton has ever won.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_290.wav|Painful, but only because it's true.|33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_291.wav|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_292.wav|The songs are just so good.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_293.wav|And it's a goodbye from him.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_294.wav|The goals will come.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_295.wav|Who can predict?|33,,,,

wav48/p260/p260_300.wav|What has altered?|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_301.wav|Nothing is safe.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_302.wav|One was a lawyer.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_303.wav|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_304.wav|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_305.wav|They are wrong.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_306.wav|I can live with it.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_307.wav|Work has started.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_308.wav|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.|33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_309.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.|33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_310.wav|You should be.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_311.wav|The minister is the engineer.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_312.wav|The letters are going out today.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_313.wav|We want to play at the worlds.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_314.wav|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_315.wav|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_316.wav|Special measures were needed.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_317.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_318.wav|The show is at an end.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_319.wav|Your father was a good man.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_320.wav|Such actions are rarely popular.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_321.wav|We have got to get the points from this one.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_322.wav|The election is total confusion and chaos.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_323.wav|Henman has been warned.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_324.wav|I would love it.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_326.wav|The problems began a long time ago.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_327.wav|For the moment, our position remains the same.|33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_328.wav|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_329.wav|We are in the end game.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_330.wav|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_331.wav|There was no time scale.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_332.wav|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_333.wav|It is a job creation scheme.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_334.wav|Relief was beyond belief.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_335.wav|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.|33,,,
wav48/p260/p260_336.wav|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_337.wav|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_338.wav|Finally, he paid for the movie.|33,,,

wav48/p260/p260_342.wav|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.|33,,
wav48/p260/p260_343.wav|He has to learn.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_344.wav|Two people were interviewed.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_345.wav|I've got no secret.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_346.wav|This is a big advantage.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_347.wav|I'm very lucky.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_348.wav|A great deal has been achieved.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_349.wav|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.|33,,
wav48/p260/p260_350.wav|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.|33,,,,
wav48/p260/p260_351.wav|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.|33,,,,

wav48/p261/p261_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |34,,
wav48/p261/p261_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |34,,
wav48/p261/p261_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |34,,
wav48/p261/p261_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |34,,
wav48/p261/p261_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|34,,
wav48/p261/p261_025.wav|They are very clever in their use of words.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_026.wav|Meetings will also remain private.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_027.wav|Because we do not need it.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_028.wav|Life was like a timetable.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_029.wav|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_030.wav|We will look into it.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_031.wav|I have never been a member of the council.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_032.wav|It was a close call.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_033.wav|That means an extra two years.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_034.wav|This film will be totally awesome.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_035.wav|That was the case with David.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_036.wav|He is believed to live in Britain.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_037.wav|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_038.wav|This represents a tough game for us.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_039.wav|Their campaign is in disarray.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_040.wav|Among them are many criminals.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_041.wav|I was released after six days.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_042.wav|That's been the difference between the sides.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_043.wav|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_044.wav|I would love to have him home.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_045.wav|He will need that machine.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_046.wav|It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_047.wav|It had little effect on European equity markets.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_048.wav|Pulled a huge number of viewers.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_049.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.|34,,
wav48/p261/p261_050.wav|There was no safety net.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_051.wav|I must take a seat.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_052.wav|It is on the news.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_053.wav|The motive for the shooting was not known.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_054.wav|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_055.wav|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_056.wav|We will pay their bills.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_057.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_058.wav|How are you, sir ?|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_059.wav|So is that it, then ?|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_060.wav|Do I have a favourite ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_061.wav|What do we do ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_062.wav|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_063.wav|Only water is currently allowed.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_064.wav|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_065.wav|It's not covered by the insurance.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_066.wav|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_067.wav|That's not the intention at all.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_068.wav|It starts with the script.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_069.wav|There could be a way back.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_070.wav|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_071.wav|Then followed a bout of flu.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_072.wav|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_073.wav|The price cuts are really exciting.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_074.wav|He is now resident in England.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_075.wav|These people are not big names.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_076.wav|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_077.wav|He is in the queue.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_078.wav|Both agreed on the success of the event.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_079.wav|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_080.wav|We have to offer value for money.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_081.wav|Our mother is very worried.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_082.wav|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_083.wav|They lived for their children.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_084.wav|Potions said he would drive.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_085.wav|They deserve a lot of credit.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_086.wav|However, it did not end that way.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_087.wav|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_088.wav|It is high time to act.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_089.wav|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_090.wav|However, on this showing it's going to be a difficult task.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_091.wav|We could not get any possession.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_092.wav|It was clear on Thursday.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_093.wav|But it is up again.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_094.wav|All the pressure will be on him.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_095.wav|You are like an animal.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_096.wav|The move follows a review of the Singapore|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_097.wav|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_098.wav|I had a ball today.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_099.wav|No, the equipment is extra.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_100.wav|It is a good lifestyle.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_101.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_102.wav|We are also looking for new licences.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_103.wav|Our house was very small.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_104.wav|It was a funny game.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_105.wav|Why do it otherwise ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_106.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_107.wav|So, did she meet him ?|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_108.wav|So what is the campaign about ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_109.wav|And does it ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_110.wav|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_111.wav|I cannot explain the grief and pain in my heart.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_112.wav|It became a national network.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_113.wav|He thought she was amazing.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_114.wav|Maybe this battle has been.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_115.wav|It isn't a happy memory.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_116.wav|Actors like to be in the centre.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_117.wav|It's not a quick fix.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_118.wav|But it took a lot of bottle.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_119.wav|Structural changes were also required.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_120.wav|I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_121.wav|It is too pretty, it is too small.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_122.wav|I was on a roll.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_123.wav|The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_124.wav|My life has changed a lot.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_125.wav|If not, a deal could take many months.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_126.wav|That would open the gates of hell.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_127.wav|He can perform well under pressure.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_128.wav|I have accepted the challenge.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_129.wav|You are a gambling man.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_130.wav|He is a great addition to our team.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_131.wav|This is a successful outcome.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_132.wav|I love the spectacle of cinema.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_133.wav|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_134.wav|We will try to find someone.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_135.wav|The others have all been in storage for some time.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_136.wav|She died at her home.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_137.wav|We could easily have lost that game.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_138.wav|Check that he is dead.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_139.wav|Several messages can be taken from the occasion.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_140.wav|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_141.wav|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_142.wav|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_143.wav|The balance isn't there at EMI.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_144.wav|I would relish the prospect.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_145.wav|It has become a way of life.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_146.wav|Like the others, he was arrested.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_147.wav|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_148.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.|34,,
wav48/p261/p261_149.wav|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_150.wav|It was by the numbers.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_151.wav|But I am still awaiting an answer.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_152.wav|We will turn the corner.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_153.wav|He was asked to quit.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_154.wav|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_155.wav|The strong pound also took its toll.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_156.wav|These days are long gone.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_157.wav|The bank was now involved.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_158.wav|We have to move forward.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_159.wav|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_160.wav|We knew we had the goal we wanted.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_161.wav|The pension levels will remain the same.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_162.wav|I would probably have to agree with him.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_163.wav|You had to go and see him.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_164.wav|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_165.wav|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_166.wav|The region is open for business.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_167.wav|They could not match it.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_168.wav|What happened in that game ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_169.wav|Are you going to win ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_170.wav|Was it the wife ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_171.wav|Why change it ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_172.wav|What do we want to do that for ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_173.wav|This is no reflection on Rangers.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_174.wav|I always felt they played for me.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_175.wav|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_176.wav|It is a body blow.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_177.wav|The jury is still out.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_178.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_179.wav|City sentiment is in his favour.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_180.wav|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_181.wav|These men could be anywhere in the world.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_182.wav|I will be in Scotland.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_183.wav|Says the Duke of York.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_184.wav|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_185.wav|I had too much to drink.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_186.wav|They need to look after themselves.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_187.wav|He prefers to play for them.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_188.wav|That is a waste of energy.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_189.wav|It could be done by experts and lawyers.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_190.wav|DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_191.wav|That was the theory, anyway.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_192.wav|It was a pre-emptive strike.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_193.wav|It had been in place since last July.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_194.wav|Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_195.wav|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_196.wav|It's very difficult to find a buyer.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_197.wav|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_198.wav|He should emerge as the winner.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_199.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_200.wav|I made a terrible start.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_201.wav|It was a moment of madness.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_202.wav|We believe a third party was involved.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_203.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_204.wav|It was his own decision.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_205.wav|Does the name matter ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_206.wav|how do you get it back ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_207.wav|What are you not good at ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_208.wav|I think, therefore I am ?|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_209.wav|Who was she ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_210.wav|A deadline is still essential.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_211.wav|I chose to go by the rules.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_212.wav|I won't make an official complaint.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_213.wav|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_214.wav|They are looking at a flotation.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_215.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_216.wav|We have an election in eight days.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_217.wav|It was far from business as usual.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_218.wav|All will be revealed in due course.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_219.wav|They have known the hard times.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_220.wav|It has been like that all year for me.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_221.wav|Construction is due to begin in February.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_222.wav|Seven people were critically injured.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_223.wav|My daughter is an adult.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_224.wav|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_225.wav|He must get to know himself.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_226.wav|It was a day for records.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_227.wav|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_228.wav|And the World Cup has not even begun.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_229.wav|Life is too short to be bitter.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_230.wav|A terrorist is a terrorist.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_231.wav|It could be to do with the location.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_232.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_233.wav|The statement contained no surprises.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_234.wav|A small number of new jobs will also be created.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_235.wav|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_236.wav|They have not been in touch with the club.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_237.wav|I need a publishing deal!|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_238.wav|They tried to give her advice.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_239.wav|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_240.wav|Of course, that is not the whole story.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_241.wav|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_242.wav|This is a family club.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_243.wav|It is the loss of my name.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_244.wav|I haven't made the donation yet.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_245.wav|Well, they were the unlucky ones.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_246.wav|The irony was not lost.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_247.wav|We have come a long way in the last few sessions.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_248.wav|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_249.wav|I was just a kid.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_250.wav|It is now the big brother.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_251.wav|They showed a lot of heart.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_252.wav|Nato was not a love affair.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_253.wav|He is due in Israel tomorrow.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_254.wav|It was a poor performance.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_255.wav|That is the consistent approach of the Government.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_256.wav|We want to play at the worlds.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_257.wav|Our idea is to share and lower the cost.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_258.wav|We will listen to any suggestion.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_259.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.|34,,
wav48/p261/p261_260.wav|I should think so, too.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_261.wav|No production contract is yet in sight.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_262.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_263.wav|It seems a shame to leave it.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_264.wav|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_265.wav|This idea has been around for four years.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_266.wav|The concerns are the same.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_267.wav|I can't get a job.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_268.wav|And they were being paid ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_269.wav|was everything done to save people ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_270.wav|What was the matter for concern ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_271.wav|Do I think about them often ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_272.wav|Is it in the right place ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_273.wav|Did he trip ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_274.wav|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_275.wav|I was ready for this.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_276.wav|They must show the commitment and the work to go with it.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_277.wav|Blair is very positive at European Councils.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_278.wav|They are interior designers and architects.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_279.wav|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_280.wav|The Scotch whisky industry is absent from the agenda.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_281.wav|The offer will run for the next three weekends.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_282.wav|At first I thought I was gone.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_283.wav|I am just trying to do my job.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_284.wav|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_285.wav|We're trying to get rounded performers.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_286.wav|They can leave at any time.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_287.wav|It has the potential to be another North Sea.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_288.wav|It would be a tragedy if it had to close.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_289.wav|He has not created a Festival resource.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_290.wav|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_291.wav|He has run a hell of a race.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_292.wav|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_293.wav|He was also married with two children.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_294.wav|It was an easy decision to come here.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_295.wav|On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_296.wav|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_297.wav|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_298.wav|A senior party insider said.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_299.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_300.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_301.wav|This will help our confidence.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_302.wav|The two companies were not for sale.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_303.wav|Her appeal is to be heard this week.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_304.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_305.wav|The cause of the accident remained unclear.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_306.wav|The partnership was set up during the summer.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_307.wav|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_308.wav|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_309.wav|We will deliver at director level.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_310.wav|Size is not the issue.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_311.wav|He will address the nation this evening.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_312.wav|They have shown a great desire and attitude.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_313.wav|Tony Blair said as little.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_314.wav|His was a huge success story.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_315.wav|We would hope to make progress on that next year.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_316.wav|That is the general feeling.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_317.wav|Holland won by five wickets.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_318.wav|He was obviously very genuine.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_319.wav|The casting is as perfect.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_320.wav|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_321.wav|A Home Office spokesman said.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_322.wav|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_323.wav|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_324.wav|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_325.wav|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_326.wav|It is a potential danger.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_327.wav|Cast Away now on general release.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_328.wav|That could bring the peace process to a standstill.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_329.wav|The City welcomed the numbers.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_330.wav|You will never get a conviction.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_331.wav|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_332.wav|That meant the search was unlawful.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_333.wav|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_334.wav|There will be good prospects ahead.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_335.wav|I would do away with the dress code.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_336.wav|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.|34,,
wav48/p261/p261_337.wav|There is a handful of rewarding paintings.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_338.wav|Both sides have been hit by injury.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_339.wav|What form did that take ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_340.wav|Are they free ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_341.wav|What are they for ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_342.wav|Is there a waiting list ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_343.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_344.wav|So what happens next ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_345.wav|This ruling is a farce.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_346.wav|Both men were on one-year contracts.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_347.wav|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_348.wav|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_349.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_350.wav|Thousands of British tourists were trapped in their hotels.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_351.wav|The whole family was in shock.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_352.wav|Public opinion was split on the proposal.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_353.wav|The election is total confusion and chaos.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_354.wav|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_355.wav|To beat the European champion is quite nice.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_356.wav|I've got a sense of humour, too.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_357.wav|Her life is now back on track.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_358.wav|There was some merit in that.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_359.wav|That is a trend which will be encouraged.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_360.wav|It's too horrible to think.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_361.wav|They are now out in the cold.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_362.wav|At first, the youngster was not keen.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_363.wav|My view has now completely changed.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_364.wav|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_365.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_366.wav|He is not very big, either.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_367.wav|Finally came the moment of truth.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_368.wav|Neither man has been charged.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_369.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_370.wav|The idea was first mooted a year ago.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_371.wav|He did a good job.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_372.wav|Had this been common practice ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_373.wav|What do they want us to do ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_374.wav|Is it worth it ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_375.wav|Does it matter ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_376.wav|He took a draw on his cigarette.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_377.wav|I am a lucky man.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_378.wav|But they have taken the lesson to heart.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_379.wav|The Allies intend to maintain the average.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_380.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_381.wav|You did not see it.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_382.wav|Alex Ferguson is the same.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_383.wav|They should take their mobile phones.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_384.wav|We regret that they were brought in the first place.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_385.wav|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_386.wav|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_387.wav|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_388.wav|He must have seen the movie.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_389.wav|We must put a marker down.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_390.wav|The result is called a patent.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_391.wav|It's as wide as a church in here.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_392.wav|This remains the party's policy.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_393.wav|The pair are very much in love.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_394.wav|I am a good player.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_395.wav|You have to rely on each other.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_396.wav|However, it was well worth the wait.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_397.wav|No other job in world football can compare to this one.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_398.wav|I wanted to go out on a high.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_399.wav|I felt the head was very like me.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_400.wav|It was fit for royalty.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_401.wav|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_402.wav|We operate as a Scottish company.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_403.wav|How do you take them away ?|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_404.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?|34,,
wav48/p261/p261_405.wav|After the match, do you ?|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_406.wav|He has been in a nursing home for two years.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_407.wav|He put some colour into Scottish history.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_408.wav|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_409.wav|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_410.wav|Motion described it as a unique event.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_411.wav|I had a fortunate war.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_412.wav|The breakdown was much later in her life.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_413.wav|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_414.wav|It is good for Europe.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_415.wav|It does not even have a staff shortage.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_416.wav|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_417.wav|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_418.wav|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_419.wav|But a surprise is in store.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_420.wav|Smoking is also very important.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_421.wav|The second goal was superb.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_422.wav|We're delighted about the vote.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_423.wav|The case will now go to appeal.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_424.wav|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_425.wav|Yet the data is compelling.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_426.wav|It was important to win the singles.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_427.wav|He's had to suffer for the last six years.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_428.wav|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_429.wav|He was on a horse.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_430.wav|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.|34,,
wav48/p261/p261_431.wav|That's the way it works.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_432.wav|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_433.wav|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_434.wav|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_435.wav|He is on the wrong side.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_436.wav|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_437.wav|It was the climax of the thing.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_438.wav|The trial will open today.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_439.wav|I'm looking for work in Bath and back home in Scotland.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_440.wav|It will make a huge difference.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_441.wav|It is an absolute nonsense.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_442.wav|Everything in golf is a balance.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_443.wav|It is a case of pity for us.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_444.wav|Gordon is also highly rated.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_445.wav|The first game is so important.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_446.wav|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_447.wav|And we might go back.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_448.wav|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_449.wav|He deserves a second chance.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_450.wav|You have to see the work.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_451.wav|The funding is now there.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_452.wav|But we have built a platform for next season.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_453.wav|I was embarrassed by it.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_454.wav|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_455.wav|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_456.wav|Paris is not only young.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_457.wav|No one wants to go through these things.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_458.wav|Our legal advice is clear.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_459.wav|It all began as an accident.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_460.wav|Long-term, it was the right thing to do.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_461.wav|It might be useful to have something in black and white.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_462.wav|They were totally behind it.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_463.wav|Let that be their memorial.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_464.wav|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_465.wav|She would take the Farmer to the opera.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_466.wav|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_467.wav|Phil Mickelson did that last year.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_468.wav|No options are excluded at all.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_469.wav|They are defined by law.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_470.wav|If that's the case, he will struggle.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_471.wav|I'm very pleased for the club and for myself.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_472.wav|It's been a long, long journey.|34,,,
wav48/p261/p261_473.wav|War is not the action.|34,,,,
wav48/p261/p261_474.wav|My place is in the kitchen.|34,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_001.wav|Please call Stella. |35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |35,,
wav48/p262/p262_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |35,,
wav48/p262/p262_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |35,,
wav48/p262/p262_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |35,,
wav48/p262/p262_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|35,,
wav48/p262/p262_025.wav|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_026.wav|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_027.wav|However, the following year the cancer returned.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_028.wav|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|35,,
wav48/p262/p262_029.wav|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_030.wav|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_031.wav|I expected these kind of questions.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_032.wav|This is the window.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_033.wav|People love to see this stuff.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_034.wav|Life was like a timetable.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_035.wav|Then, suddenly, they weren't.|35,,
wav48/p262/p262_036.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_037.wav|It was clear.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_038.wav|The problem is the pitch.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_039.wav|It was ugly.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_040.wav|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_041.wav|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_042.wav|The judge said.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_043.wav|It's a crucial award.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_044.wav|It is difficult for Ali.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_045.wav|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_046.wav|I was angry.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_047.wav|It has been a horrible, horrible time.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_048.wav|They had to explain it.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_049.wav|He had no enemies.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_050.wav|We were surprised to see the photograph.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_051.wav|Next league matches Celtic.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_052.wav|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_053.wav|It's very odd.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_054.wav|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_055.wav|It's not pretty, but it's effective.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_056.wav|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_057.wav|New York is expected to come to a standstill.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_058.wav|Jobs could go.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_059.wav|And a film maker was born.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_060.wav|I fell against him.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_061.wav|There was a battle there.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_062.wav|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_063.wav|And if he hadn't become a musician?|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_064.wav|He was popular.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_065.wav|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_066.wav|It is like a river running by my home.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_067.wav|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_068.wav|It's all I can do.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_069.wav|He highlighted a lack of staff.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_070.wav|Then followed a bout of flu.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_071.wav|The girls are so lucky to be alive.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_072.wav|I had my suspicions.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_073.wav|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.|35,,
wav48/p262/p262_074.wav|I've not thought about it.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_075.wav|What has changed?|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_076.wav|I'd like to continue that record.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_077.wav|Detection is often difficult.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_078.wav|He is driven.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_079.wav|All options are open.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_080.wav|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_081.wav|Someone who cares|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_082.wav|It's never too late.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_083.wav|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_084.wav|That will come after the game on Saturday.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_085.wav|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_086.wav|Today I couldn't run on it.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_087.wav|Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_088.wav|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_089.wav|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_090.wav|Then came the crunch.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_091.wav|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_092.wav|They are now divorced.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_093.wav|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_094.wav|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_095.wav|FOR once, you should believe the hype.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_096.wav|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_097.wav|It is a good day for the coalition.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_098.wav|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_099.wav|Two of the team became ill.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_100.wav|Oil embargo endorsed.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_101.wav|It is a good lifestyle.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_102.wav|It was an adventure.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_103.wav|It's not perfect.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_104.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_105.wav|He pleaded for caution.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_106.wav|They are ready.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_107.wav|It's a shame.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_108.wav|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_109.wav|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_110.wav|They were behind the wheel.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_111.wav|This film will be totally awesome.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_112.wav|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_113.wav|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_114.wav|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_115.wav|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_116.wav|Who would have?|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_117.wav|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_118.wav|I felt very strongly that England should have it.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_119.wav|Next season for every manager is a long time away.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_120.wav|They keep the atmosphere in mind.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_121.wav|So the European elections are extremely important.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_122.wav|It was the same at Twickenham.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_123.wav|It plans to return to this field.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_124.wav|Our intentions are real.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_125.wav|The goals were good.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_126.wav|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_127.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_128.wav|Nobody in the world can get away from him.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_129.wav|It's a question of fashion.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_130.wav|It seems so long since I did the exams.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_131.wav|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_132.wav|We need to chat.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_133.wav|She died at her home.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_134.wav|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_135.wav|It would be a last resort.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_136.wav|That group reported just before Christmas.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_137.wav|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_138.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_139.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_140.wav|It is huge.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_141.wav|I've got to hold my own hands up for this one.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_142.wav|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_143.wav|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_144.wav|Mr Blair had done well.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_145.wav|We also enjoyed a lot of support.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_146.wav|We should be clear about the role of government.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_147.wav|It is a freedom.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_148.wav|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_149.wav|I knew he was good.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_150.wav|They were later discharged from hospital.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_151.wav|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.|35,,
wav48/p262/p262_152.wav|Neither side can win this war.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_153.wav|He can do no wrong.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_154.wav|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_155.wav|A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_156.wav|He's been the key to everything.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_157.wav|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_158.wav|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_159.wav|As, indeed, they would be.|35,,
wav48/p262/p262_160.wav|They are not advertised.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_161.wav|We knew we had the goal we wanted.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_162.wav|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_163.wav|It's that sort of night.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_164.wav|It is not too late to get on board.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_165.wav|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.|35,,
wav48/p262/p262_166.wav|We have a budget in March.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_167.wav|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_168.wav|The post will be unpaid.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_169.wav|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_170.wav|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_171.wav|We've made a couple of albums.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_172.wav|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_173.wav|Is Saddam a threat?|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_174.wav|I feel like my game has come a long way.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_175.wav|We wanted it left for a wee while.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_176.wav|The clarity is vital.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_177.wav|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.|35,,
wav48/p262/p262_178.wav|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_179.wav|That has been the easy part.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_180.wav|He will need that machine.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_181.wav|Nothing is safe.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_182.wav|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_183.wav|They need to look after themselves.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_184.wav|Miller was every bit as happy.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_185.wav|I had a train to catch.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_186.wav|That would be my view.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_187.wav|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_188.wav|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_189.wav|We must keep our feet on the ground.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_190.wav|It wasn't to be.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_191.wav|I came home by ambulance.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_192.wav|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_193.wav|Our strategy is straightforward.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_194.wav|The group is separate from the Real IRA.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_195.wav|People acted too quickly.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_196.wav|The service from the other players was super.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_197.wav|He's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_198.wav|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_199.wav|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_200.wav|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_201.wav|They are in the euro.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_202.wav|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_203.wav|It's all about money, money, money.|35,,
wav48/p262/p262_204.wav|There was no rescue.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_205.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_206.wav|But I am a worried man.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_207.wav|There was an e-mail.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_208.wav|It's a big deal for me.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_209.wav|We'll have to work hard today.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_210.wav|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_211.wav|I had decided to quit the show.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_212.wav|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_213.wav|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_214.wav|He seemed to lose his focus.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_215.wav|Work has started.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_216.wav|His death was a tragic accident.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_217.wav|But the military campaign is a military campaign against Osama bin Laden.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_218.wav|IT S the real thing, for sure.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_219.wav|We have not given up hope.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_220.wav|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_221.wav|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_222.wav|Clearly, the stakes are high.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_223.wav|It's a question of creating a future awareness.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_224.wav|The track is currently covered in snow.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_225.wav|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.|35,,
wav48/p262/p262_226.wav|At the time, he was a living legend.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_227.wav|The Dow Jones is way up.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_228.wav|However, no further action was taken by police.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_229.wav|It's that kind of place.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_230.wav|But you think I'm going to argue with the big man?|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_231.wav|Half of young people had had contact with the police.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_232.wav|It's very safe.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_233.wav|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_234.wav|It is a terrible loss.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_235.wav|But it's a subtle process.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_236.wav|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_237.wav|Of further privacy, he had no need.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_238.wav|He was good, but not that good.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_239.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_240.wav|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_241.wav|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_242.wav|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_243.wav|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_244.wav|They may yet have the last laugh.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_245.wav|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_246.wav|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_247.wav|The scene is about this?|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_248.wav|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_249.wav|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_250.wav|I was shocked.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_251.wav|A friendship that will endure.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_252.wav|I didn't need to watch it on the video.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_253.wav|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_254.wav|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_255.wav|That could be in place by next year.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_256.wav|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_257.wav|We run within the law.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_258.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_259.wav|This is a big club.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_260.wav|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_261.wav|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_262.wav|I am very angry.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_263.wav|I saw one body.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_264.wav|At first I thought I was gone.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_265.wav|They wanted the club to make money.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_266.wav|We shall rely on human beings.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_267.wav|Immediate action must be taken.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_268.wav|It's very nice.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_269.wav|He was also married with two children.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_270.wav|It was an easy decision to come here.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_271.wav|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_272.wav|It's not even finished.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_273.wav|Things can change.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_274.wav|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.|35,,
wav48/p262/p262_275.wav|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_276.wav|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_277.wav|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_278.wav|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_279.wav|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_280.wav|We have to break that cycle.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_281.wav|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_282.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_283.wav|I saw it at a ruck.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_284.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_285.wav|He will address the nation this evening.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_286.wav|The attacker died in the crash.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_287.wav|It was a virus.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_288.wav|The mood is good.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_289.wav|This is a national crisis.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_290.wav|The death toll included five children.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_291.wav|Who did the recruiting?|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_292.wav|Mr Campbell received a phone call.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_293.wav|It's a lovely, lovely film.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_294.wav|Well, he can do it.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_295.wav|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_296.wav|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_297.wav|And huge, indeed, it is.|35,,
wav48/p262/p262_298.wav|The results are sometimes contentious.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_299.wav|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_300.wav|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_301.wav|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_302.wav|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_303.wav|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_304.wav|What has altered?|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_305.wav|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_306.wav|One was a lawyer.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_307.wav|However, the groups denied the claims.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_308.wav|They should be swept away.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_309.wav|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_310.wav|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_311.wav|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_312.wav|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_313.wav|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_314.wav|The letters are going out today.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_315.wav|We want to play at the worlds.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_316.wav|Is there on his hands?|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_317.wav|Special measures were needed.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_318.wav|It's about my time as a guitarist.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_319.wav|I never thought it would take this long.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_320.wav|In fact, they have the opposite effect.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_321.wav|We are a peaceful people.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_322.wav|It should be equal.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_323.wav|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_324.wav|The problems began a long time ago.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_325.wav|My body is clearly capable.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_326.wav|He said she was mad.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_327.wav|It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_328.wav|Davis is very supportive, as a director.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_329.wav|We are in the end game.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_330.wav|In his absence, the council adopted the change.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_331.wav|The parents will have a great time, too.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_332.wav|I am so upset.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_333.wav|It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_334.wav|It could have gone either way.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_335.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_336.wav|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_337.wav|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_338.wav|The team for the first game could be this one.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_339.wav|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_340.wav|The Scottish Prison Service said it could not comment on the visit.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_341.wav|His views are hardly surprising.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_342.wav|I would miss him.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_343.wav|It will be very, very tight.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_344.wav|That is the very reason why it was so vital.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_345.wav|It was forced to divert.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_346.wav|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_347.wav|Chambers said he would accept the place.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_348.wav|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_349.wav|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_350.wav|I got a yellow card.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_351.wav|There is no link.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_352.wav|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_353.wav|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_354.wav|The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_355.wav|A man has since been charged with his murder.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_356.wav|It is horrible.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_357.wav|The council said the house would have to be demolished.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_358.wav|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_359.wav|He's very explosive.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_360.wav|It was one in the afternoon.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_361.wav|We will be homeless.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_362.wav|That would help.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_363.wav|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_364.wav|It was a double tragedy for the family.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_365.wav|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_366.wav|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_367.wav|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_368.wav|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_369.wav|Talks are progressing.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_370.wav|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_371.wav|It was a funny game.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_372.wav|It is a large number.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_373.wav|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_374.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.|35,,
wav48/p262/p262_375.wav|I am a wealthy person.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_376.wav|Something is wrong.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_377.wav|Mentally, you have to be tough.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_378.wav|I am very happy with life.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_379.wav|I was so nervous.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_380.wav|We have to reduce the number of plastic bags.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_381.wav|However, it's good to turn the page.|35,,,
wav48/p262/p262_382.wav|It would be a massive boost for them.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_383.wav|The release attracted little attention.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_384.wav|It was important to win the singles.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_385.wav|Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_386.wav|We're looking for justice.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_387.wav|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_388.wav|They are good.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_389.wav|It was a breathtaking moment.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_390.wav|It was on fire.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_391.wav|This is a major step forward for carers.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_392.wav|But, in fact, the reverse is true.|35,,
wav48/p262/p262_393.wav|Emotions were complex.|35,,,,
wav48/p262/p262_394.wav|His remarks appear to have had an effect.|35,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_001.wav|Please call Stella. |36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |36,,
wav48/p263/p263_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |36,,
wav48/p263/p263_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |36,,
wav48/p263/p263_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |36,,
wav48/p263/p263_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|36,,
wav48/p263/p263_025.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_026.wav|How are you, sir ?|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_027.wav|So is that it, then ?|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_028.wav|Do I have a favourite ?|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_029.wav|What do we do ?|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_030.wav|We would like to find another region to develop in England.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_031.wav|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_032.wav|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_033.wav|Allan Johnston was not match fit.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_034.wav|The idea is not new.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_035.wav|I could not do it.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_036.wav|Life was like a timetable.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_037.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_038.wav|You have to expect this type of thing.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_039.wav|No company would want to put their people at risk.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_040.wav|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_041.wav|It could well be the case.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_042.wav|This work on a marketing strategy would be finished within two months.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_043.wav|She is believed to be in South Africa.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_044.wav|It will come all right.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_045.wav|It seemed the tough times were behind him.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_046.wav|That company should not be allowed to operate in this country.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_047.wav|The Yugoslav president said he did not recognise the election outcome.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_048.wav|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_049.wav|I didn't think any player was a success on Saturday.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_050.wav|People were determined to change the Government in the last election.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_051.wav|I would love to have him home.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_052.wav|He looks like an Afghan.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_053.wav|He will need that machine.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_054.wav|Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_055.wav|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_056.wav|We have not given up hope.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_057.wav|It will now take over the running of the estate.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_058.wav|I've got to provide for my family.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_059.wav|It was bound to happen.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_060.wav|Four other charges were dropped.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_061.wav|We have to keep our clients.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_062.wav|Indeed, it is only the beginning.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_063.wav|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_064.wav|I am pleased to be in them.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_065.wav|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_066.wav|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_067.wav|There is an element of racism in Scotland.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_068.wav|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_069.wav|It is the only way forward for the club.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_070.wav|I was very pleased with them today, though.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_071.wav|It's all I can do.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_072.wav|The girls are so lucky to be alive.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_073.wav|It was nice to get a clean sheet.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_074.wav|It is a job creation scheme.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_075.wav|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_076.wav|Even the one she loved.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_077.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_078.wav|So, did she meet him ?|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_079.wav|So what is the campaign about ?|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_080.wav|And does it ?|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_081.wav|Are you from the rugby ?|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_082.wav|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_083.wav|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_084.wav|The insurance company is only interested in your profits.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_085.wav|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_086.wav|Thomson is expected to manage the business.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_087.wav|The damage from the fire was huge.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_088.wav|A play is a set of actions.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_089.wav|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_090.wav|Scottish rugby has been in a state of civil war.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_091.wav|I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_092.wav|The first few days will determine whether she can survive.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_093.wav|The trick is to try it.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_094.wav|The city council is a major property owner in the area.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_095.wav|It might change your life.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_096.wav|No-one in the passenger train was hurt.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_097.wav|Mr Blair should be warned.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_098.wav|You might not make it.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_099.wav|Officers recovered a second body in the area.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_100.wav|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_101.wav|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_102.wav|I did not have a bet on myself.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_103.wav|I saw the whole thing.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_104.wav|A progress report will be published in October.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_105.wav|The investment will be in the food.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_106.wav|There is a contract in existence for Allan.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_107.wav|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_108.wav|Our preference is to play in midweek.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_109.wav|You are like an animal.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_110.wav|In the end we made too many errors.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_111.wav|It has been a nightmare of frustration.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_112.wav|That all hope is never lost.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_113.wav|It should be a great game, though.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_114.wav|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_115.wav|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_116.wav|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_117.wav|He was jailed for a year.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_118.wav|It was won on the issue of the land.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_119.wav|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_120.wav|The fire was above the hole.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_121.wav|Pupils will be the losers.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_122.wav|The problem was a social problem.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_123.wav|Such actions are rarely popular.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_124.wav|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_125.wav|It isn't a happy memory.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_126.wav|When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_127.wav|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_128.wav|They've got to account for it.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_129.wav|It was his conclusion that they were generally in good condition.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_130.wav|It would be great to reward the Scottish public with a win.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_131.wav|You can spend money on housing.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_132.wav|I told him I was a long time ago.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_133.wav|They have to come clean.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_134.wav|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_135.wav|I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_136.wav|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_137.wav|It is just a tax on employment.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_138.wav|The move has provoked a mixed response.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_139.wav|The squad is too small.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_140.wav|Why change it ?|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_141.wav|What do we want to do that for ?|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_142.wav|Does the name matter ?|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_143.wav|how do you get it back ?|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_144.wav|The temperature in the town is very difficult to control.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_145.wav|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_146.wav|Any success would have been an improvement.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_147.wav|Losing in that manner is very hard to take.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_148.wav|I never wanted a legal battle.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_149.wav|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_150.wav|Next time round, it will be different.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_151.wav|She died at her home.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_152.wav|We have seen a copy of the report.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_153.wav|But the Commission is on a collision course with the Government.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_154.wav|It is the quality of the work that counts.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_155.wav|Check that he is dead.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_156.wav|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_157.wav|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_158.wav|There is no mandate for a regime change.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_159.wav|Like the others, he was arrested.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_160.wav|She will do for me.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_161.wav|I have had a good life.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_162.wav|It was deployed in the Gulf War.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_163.wav|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_164.wav|It is crucial for both teams.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_165.wav|However, she did not report the matter to the police.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_166.wav|Nobody in Scotland has recognised the creative talent involved in this area.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_167.wav|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_168.wav|The other businesses were based in Yorkshire and Northern Ireland.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_169.wav|I would like to see the figures for the second quarter.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_170.wav|Neither side can win this war.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_171.wav|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_172.wav|These days are long gone.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_173.wav|It is an attitude of mind.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_174.wav|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_175.wav|Eight months later, he was dead.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_176.wav|Worry can have that effect on some citizens.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_177.wav|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_178.wav|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_179.wav|So was the first half.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_180.wav|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_181.wav|The decision was blamed on weak investment markets.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_182.wav|It's nice to be involved.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_183.wav|Irvine said his company was intent on supporting the Scottish dairy industry.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_184.wav|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_185.wav|Waiting times for these services are too long.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_186.wav|Time is now very short.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_187.wav|Our position remains the same.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_188.wav|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_189.wav|The region is open for business.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_190.wav|I feel like my game has come a long way.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_191.wav|The championship is different from the other majors.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_192.wav|It makes no influence on the public.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_193.wav|I thought he did very well.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_194.wav|Says the Duke of York.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_195.wav|The shooting created panic in the street.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_196.wav|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_197.wav|It could be done by experts and lawyers.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_198.wav|You know the sort of thing.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_199.wav|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_200.wav|We are committed to realising the potential of every child.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_201.wav|It is a terrible loss.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_202.wav|I think, therefore I am ?|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_203.wav|Who was she ?|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_204.wav|Or was it ?|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_205.wav|And they were being paid ?|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_206.wav|Two years later, she was dead.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_207.wav|It is not easy to live in Russia.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_208.wav|It is difficult to comment on the prospects for the year ahead.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_209.wav|However, this idea is never developed.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_210.wav|We believe the world has too many refugees already.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_211.wav|We must keep our feet on the ground.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_212.wav|It is hard to tell.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_213.wav|He should emerge as the winner.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_214.wav|I came home by ambulance.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_215.wav|This decision was taken with the full support of Scottish ministers.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_216.wav|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_217.wav|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_218.wav|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_219.wav|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_220.wav|They are in the euro.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_221.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_222.wav|The defender should have won the bloody ba.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_223.wav|A deadline is still essential.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_224.wav|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_225.wav|Bombing is the easy option.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_226.wav|He added that he was very sad about O Neill.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_227.wav|Abbey National is an option.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_228.wav|We can hardly talk about it.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_229.wav|It was located on the remote control.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_230.wav|It is safe in our hands.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_231.wav|I'm just a regular person.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_232.wav|I am considered a teenager.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_233.wav|In each case they were a goal down.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_234.wav|It's just a normal life.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_235.wav|He remains a main board director of Royal.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_236.wav|People should make their own decisions.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_237.wav|That you can do it.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_238.wav|We will reform the welfare state.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_239.wav|It could be to do with the location.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_241.wav|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_242.wav|She will attend in July.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_243.wav|The body follows the mind.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_244.wav|I always felt that I was in control of the match.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_245.wav|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_246.wav|That will be the criteria for the future.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_247.wav|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_248.wav|We were a load of rubbish.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_249.wav|He has run a hell of a race.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_250.wav|What was the matter for concern ?|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_251.wav|Do I think about them often ?|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_252.wav|Is it in the right place ?|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_253.wav|Did he trip ?|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_254.wav|Does that put pressure on us ?|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_255.wav|Frankly, it was worth the booking.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_256.wav|The deal is expected to be completed by next summer.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_257.wav|The irony was not lost.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_258.wav|Three weeks later, he resigned.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_259.wav|We have a free vote on these things in our party.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_260.wav|It might be sad, but it's a fact.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_261.wav|You look like a rugby player.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_262.wav|Chairman Sir Alistair Grant will remain on the board as deputy chairman.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_263.wav|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_264.wav|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_265.wav|You can feel at home in China.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_266.wav|We've got a lot of that sort of nonsense in the North-east.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_267.wav|The whole point is to get the issue into the open.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_268.wav|My son was too young to die.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_269.wav|It should have taken a year for a company this size.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_270.wav|We were not allowed to go to help them.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_271.wav|I didn't see the point.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_272.wav|It seems a shame to leave it.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_273.wav|The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_274.wav|I can't get a job.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_275.wav|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_276.wav|That could be in place by next year.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_277.wav|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_278.wav|The distinction is also supported by doctors.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_279.wav|They must show the commitment and the work to go with it.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_280.wav|They must play for each other.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_281.wav|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_282.wav|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_283.wav|They can leave at any time.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_284.wav|I was delighted with the way he jumped.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_285.wav|Much of the equipment was new.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_286.wav|You get a lot for your money.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_287.wav|An announcement will follow in due course.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_288.wav|He has not created a Festival resource.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_289.wav|He was also married with two children.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_291.wav|I was first in the door.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_292.wav|Access has been a nightmare.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_293.wav|Further expansion has been achieved in Germany and Italy.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_294.wav|It will always be the highlight of my career.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_295.wav|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_296.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_297.wav|She failed in her action.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_298.wav|Its body language is all wrong.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_299.wav|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_300.wav|The record companies have gone through the floor.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_301.wav|So the Government will be damaged.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_302.wav|I have lost all confidence.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_303.wav|John was there already in spirit.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_304.wav|In the end, it was no choice.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_305.wav|Are they free ?|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_306.wav|What are they for ?|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_307.wav|Is there a waiting list ?|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_308.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_309.wav|I intended to look for another club on loan.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_310.wav|However, a ruling will not come before next week.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_311.wav|Motherwell have no such good fortune.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_312.wav|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_313.wav|I have decided to stand down from the list.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_314.wav|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_315.wav|They had to learn to work from the consumer back.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_316.wav|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_317.wav|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_318.wav|Nothing has been put into action.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_319.wav|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_320.wav|Like many companies, it is a problem.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_321.wav|Action must be taken to slow down the traffic.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_322.wav|However, a bid was never made.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_323.wav|We're not an employment agency.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_324.wav|I could not have hoped to run at this level.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_325.wav|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_326.wav|The following year was a miserable time for Mr Dewar.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_327.wav|At the moment, it is very difficult to know.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_328.wav|They come to enjoy themselves.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_329.wav|There's still a bit to go.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_330.wav|We have a good healthy debate.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_331.wav|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_332.wav|It is a court case.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_333.wav|The minister is the engineer.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_334.wav|There is no plan B.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_335.wav|He will go a long way.|36,,,,

wav48/p263/p263_347.wav|The airport was even different.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_348.wav|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_349.wav|It is the same old story.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_350.wav|Analysts were not surprised at the talks between the companies.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_351.wav|Overall, we are very pleased.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_352.wav|It was tough to contain the excitement.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_353.wav|Does it matter ?|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_354.wav|How do you take them away ?|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_355.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?|36,,
wav48/p263/p263_356.wav|After the match, do you ?|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_357.wav|The pain was almost too much to bear.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_358.wav|Whether this return was too soon.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_359.wav|There is a good example in this city.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_360.wav|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_361.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_362.wav|That's as it should be.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_363.wav|The key player in this matter is now the Prime Minister.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_364.wav|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_365.wav|There is a range of employers.|36,,,,

wav48/p263/p263_369.wav|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.|36,,,,

wav48/p263/p263_373.wav|They may yet have the last laugh.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_374.wav|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_375.wav|And I repeat, it would be for exposure and money.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_376.wav|Like his acting, it was an accident.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_377.wav|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_378.wav|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.|36,,,,

wav48/p263/p263_385.wav|Scottish teams have got to take their chances.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_386.wav|We are delighted at the response from potential employers.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_387.wav|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_388.wav|You have to rely on each other.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_389.wav|This season has been a nightmare.|36,,,,

wav48/p263/p263_399.wav|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.|36,,,,

wav48/p263/p263_401.wav|He's in his element and the audience is delighted by him.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_402.wav|He replied that it was a dilemma.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_403.wav|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_404.wav|He said the Parliament should be left to make its own decision.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_405.wav|MAN is fully listed on the London Stock Exchange.|36,,,,

wav48/p263/p263_407.wav|The Cabinet is split over the issue.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_408.wav|It was an amazing afternoon.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_409.wav|The casualties were not named.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_410.wav|We shall not be moved.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_411.wav|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_412.wav|It looked like a river.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_413.wav|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_414.wav|Once again, they were back amongst the big boys.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_415.wav|It was important to win the singles.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_416.wav|I'm pleased about one thing.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_417.wav|His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_418.wav|I had a tie in my hand.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_419.wav|I can lead by example.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_420.wav|Such an attack is bizarre.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_421.wav|Today, the story is different.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_422.wav|The Queen Mother is dead.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_423.wav|Head injuries are the leading cause of death.|36,,,,

wav48/p263/p263_426.wav|A police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_427.wav|But we are severely limited in funds.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_428.wav|Together, we can make a difference.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_429.wav|It is that sort of film.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_430.wav|Mr Reid said the repeal was a sensitive issue.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_431.wav|They recorded their debut album in New York.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_432.wav|A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_433.wav|Which may be the same thing.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_434.wav|It is not a standing army.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_435.wav|We know about the crisis in cattle.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_436.wav|As it turned out it was a triumph.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_437.wav|We shall not forget him.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_438.wav|I can't wait for the season to end.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_439.wav|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_440.wav|I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_441.wav|You have got to be careful.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_442.wav|There is The Beautiful Game to write.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_443.wav|No decisions have been made in this respect.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_444.wav|It wouldn't matter if he had.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_445.wav|No, because it was too many.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_446.wav|He deserves a second chance.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_447.wav|I believed that effort was needed in our own area.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_448.wav|It is not over by any means.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_449.wav|The second goal was a terrible mistake by our defence.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_450.wav|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_451.wav|It is a tough game but we have a chance.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_452.wav|But we have built a platform for next season.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_453.wav|It looked like a war zone.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_454.wav|Legal opinion is that I may have a case.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_455.wav|However, one has arrived in the post.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_456.wav|They offer a kind of narrative.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_457.wav|He looked on the deal as a merger rather than a takeover.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_458.wav|He doesn't like the Labour Party.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_459.wav|It goes with the job.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_460.wav|It has been a waste of time.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_461.wav|The rest of the business is very robust.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_462.wav|I saw it didn't work.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_463.wav|To tell the truth, it wasn't a good game.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_464.wav|We are over the moon.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_465.wav|It was another reminder of the power of an image.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_466.wav|They're just a good retailer.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_467.wav|Tickets will be at a premium.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_468.wav|It's been a long, long journey.|36,,,
wav48/p263/p263_469.wav|I just got under the ball a bit.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_470.wav|There is a similar story for milk and dairy products.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_471.wav|That should get their attention.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_472.wav|It's just a place to open it.|36,,,,
wav48/p263/p263_473.wav|My place is in the kitchen.|36,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_001.wav|Please call Stella. )|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. )|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. )|37,,
wav48/p264/p264_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. )|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. )|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. )|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. )|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. )|37,,
wav48/p264/p264_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. )|37,,
wav48/p264/p264_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. )|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. )|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. )|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. )|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. )|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. )|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. )|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. )|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. )|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. )|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. )|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. )|37,,
wav48/p264/p264_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.)|37,,
wav48/p264/p264_025.wav|The west coast line is not just for middle England.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_026.wav|I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_027.wav|He does not even trust his own members.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_028.wav|We're only taking on a couple just now.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_029.wav|The local primary is excellent.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_030.wav|Do not give your details to anyone.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_031.wav|I feel I did not have enough time.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_032.wav|He added that her comments were noted.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_033.wav|It felt right for me.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_034.wav|We are opening an inquiry.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_035.wav|This remains the case.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_036.wav|Certainly, we do as well.)|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_037.wav|It carried a double message.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_038.wav|It was a total surprise.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_039.wav|I wish I could see it again.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_040.wav|I am secure in my owns position.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_041.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.)|37,,
wav48/p264/p264_042.wav|It is a complex deal.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_043.wav|I made my mind up before we came on tour.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_044.wav|It does not stop here.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_045.wav|We're working on it night and day.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_046.wav|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_047.wav|The results, out tomorrow, will focus on the company's strategy.)|37,,
wav48/p264/p264_048.wav|There remains some Scottish influence, however.)|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_049.wav|I only signed this morning.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_050.wav|The Office is a show about nothing, then.)|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_051.wav|We were leading by two goals.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_053.wav|It was dangerous but vital employment.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_054.wav|All options are available.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_055.wav|How are you, sir?)|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_056.wav|So is that it, then?)|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_057.wav|Do I have a favourite?)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_058.wav|What do we do?)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_059.wav|Why do it otherwise?)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_060.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?)|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_061.wav|So, did she meet him?)|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_062.wav|It happens from time to time.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_063.wav|You could very well be.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_064.wav|People come to see the Highlands.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_065.wav|It is nice to be a woman and a wife.)|37,,,,

wav48/p264/p264_067.wav|Things have just worked out this way.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_068.wav|That is not possible.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_069.wav|This is far too high.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_070.wav|He has real potential.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_071.wav|But I had never been in a theatre.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_072.wav|Without doubt, the debate on education is welcome.)|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_073.wav|Confidence is as low as it can get.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_074.wav|I think with my experience I can help the team.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_075.wav|That is really all.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_076.wav|The deal was done on Wednesday.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_077.wav|The time has arrived for a review.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_078.wav|That is very important.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_079.wav|Only water is currently allowed.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_080.wav|Put simply, it goes something like this.)|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_081.wav|Over one million people have been forced from their homes.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_082.wav|It looks that way.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_083.wav|Now comes the hard part.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_084.wav|Maybe they will see sense.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_085.wav|We're at home, which is important.)|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_086.wav|Because I was a very physical person.)|37,,,,

wav48/p264/p264_100.wav|His massive advantage was never under threat yesterday.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_101.wav|Two of our crew were killed.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_102.wav|I feel confident about the outcome.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_103.wav|The referee had been right.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_104.wav|Jack was always going to win this one.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_105.wav|It would be easy to think so.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_106.wav|You're quite wrong, he said.)|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_107.wav|I was born for this moment.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_108.wav|I first met him last summer.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_109.wav|The newspapers, by contrast, had held their value.)|37,,
wav48/p264/p264_110.wav|You can maintain regular contact.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_112.wav|This makes up for it.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_113.wav|Firm action must be taken.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_114.wav|But they had to be paid for.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_115.wav|That's the bit that's wrong.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_116.wav|Nothing would now surprise me.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_117.wav|Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.)|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_118.wav|But I am in practice.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_119.wav|Trading is tough at the moment.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_120.wav|It came a bit late.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_121.wav|All music goes into me.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_122.wav|That was a great performance by the team.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_123.wav|It seemed like four hours.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_124.wav|The family moved around a lot.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_125.wav|We beat the Welsh team.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_126.wav|An announcement is expected within a few months.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_127.wav|We have a team to reach the final.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_128.wav|Eight others have followed.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_129.wav|These people were my friends.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_130.wav|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_131.wav|It's nice to see a very positive style of football.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_132.wav|This commitment should be built upon.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_133.wav|I hope we've reached the bottom now.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_134.wav|This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_135.wav|Domestic orders have also fallen since January.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_136.wav|However, it's possible that Dick can have influence some Dutch players to go there.)|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_137.wav|This is a separate announcement which is in a different league.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_138.wav|It's very dangerous for markets.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_139.wav|He said some things which were better left alone.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_140.wav|He nearly killed my son.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_141.wav|That comes at a cost.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_142.wav|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.)|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_143.wav|I told them during their morning break.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_144.wav|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_145.wav|The truth will come out.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_146.wav|Mr Dewar understood that.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_147.wav|She's been shot.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_148.wav|Do I think about them often?)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_149.wav|Is it in the right place?)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_150.wav|Did he trip?)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_151.wav|Does that put pressure on us?)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_152.wav|Did it work?)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_153.wav|Their moment had come, or so they said.)|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_154.wav|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_155.wav|The second failed completely.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_156.wav|It gives a commitment.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_157.wav|Now it was Britain's turn.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_158.wav|We have come a long way since then.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_159.wav|Sport is good for you.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_160.wav|It was clearly not a battle.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_161.wav|No such meeting took place.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_162.wav|It is just too tough.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_163.wav|There is no doubt there's room for us.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_164.wav|The options seem limited.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_165.wav|It's been my life.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_166.wav|Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_167.wav|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_168.wav|Everything people said about it was true.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_169.wav|I've no idea how it works.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_170.wav|No, but my wife is.)|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_171.wav|It is a large number.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_172.wav|I'm taking each day as it comes.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_173.wav|Art can challenge our value system.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_174.wav|Now he's back on top again.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_176.wav|No-one wants to talk about death.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_177.wav|Once again, he refused.)|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_178.wav|We just want this session to end.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_179.wav|You can spend money on housing.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_180.wav|I've never had a year like this.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_181.wav|Neil has worked hard throughout his career.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_182.wav|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_183.wav|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_184.wav|She really suffered for her art.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_185.wav|The single currency could well lead to a single tax policy.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_186.wav|She runs like her mother.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_187.wav|I remember that day well.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_188.wav|In short, the national team without Frank is like football without feet.)|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_189.wav|They were certainly tough, but totally fair.)|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_190.wav|The questions came quick and fast.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_191.wav|We tried four banks.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_192.wav|Is there a waiting list?)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_193.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them?)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_194.wav|So what happens next?)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_195.wav|Had this been common practice?)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_196.wav|What do they want us to do?)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_197.wav|Is it worth it?)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_198.wav|Does it matter?)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_199.wav|How do you take them away?)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_200.wav|At half-time he was presented to both teams.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_201.wav|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_202.wav|I was independent but I am not now.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_203.wav|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_204.wav|People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_205.wav|I saw people on fire.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_206.wav|This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_207.wav|Both leaders were joined by senior party figures.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_208.wav|Her experience is certainly limited.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_209.wav|The labour side has developed in the North area.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_210.wav|He suffered severe head injuries.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_211.wav|He was a home referee.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_212.wav|Brian was last to join.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_213.wav|It was men against boys.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_214.wav|Three hit the target.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_215.wav|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_216.wav|Henry should go now.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_217.wav|Now we have fresh hope.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_218.wav|Life is still very tough for them.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_219.wav|It was a piece of art.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_221.wav|Britain will be little affected.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_222.wav|The two companies were not for sale.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_223.wav|IT has been a tough year for Scottish business.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_224.wav|It was all great training.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_226.wav|No partners would lose their jobs.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_227.wav|I was in daily contact.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_228.wav|He talks too much.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_230.wav|Many changes are positive changes.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_231.wav|This is absolutely not true.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_232.wav|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_233.wav|It was a great evening.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_234.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there?)|37,,
wav48/p264/p264_235.wav|After the match, do you?)|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_236.wav|Has the conflict started?)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_237.wav|Have I really come to this?)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_238.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_240.wav|This is a big game for both of us.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_241.wav|He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_242.wav|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_243.wav|Eight months later, he was dead.)|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_244.wav|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_245.wav|I go home only once.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_246.wav|It is based on population rather than need.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_247.wav|Progress, however, is only achieved through hard work and heavy investment.)|37,,
wav48/p264/p264_248.wav|They were game, but not very good.)|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_249.wav|I did not vote either way.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_250.wav|We really are a team.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_251.wav|I hit you there.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_252.wav|The pension levels will remain the same.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_253.wav|He is keen to stay in public service.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_254.wav|For that reason cover should not be given.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_255.wav|He felt too close to head office.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_256.wav|We have brought the staff back on board.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_257.wav|We had a right to expect those days were over.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_258.wav|The group's increasing scale will help.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_259.wav|We were looking for a base.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_260.wav|We had a grand view.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_261.wav|Walker declined to put a figure on losses.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_262.wav|They made such decisions in London.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_263.wav|The proposal was rejected.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_264.wav|This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_265.wav|Some changes have been achieved at great cost.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_266.wav|Everyone wanted him to win.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_267.wav|I was totally wrong.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_268.wav|I may play with two players up, maybe not.)|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_269.wav|Others get through it.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_270.wav|I knew him well.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_271.wav|I see no reason to doubt that the situation in Scotland is any different.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_272.wav|All films open tomorrow)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_273.wav|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.)|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_274.wav|The third has yet to be named.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_275.wav|He was called in by the government last year to report on pension reform.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_276.wav|Scots police had been asked to join the search to find him.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_277.wav|People realise we have a job to do.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_278.wav|I'm interested in interesting work.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_279.wav|It would be nice to be involved in another victory.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_280.wav|Sales will begin by the end of October.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_281.wav|He will get his chances.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_282.wav|Friday night was a pretty good night.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_283.wav|She now lives in London.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_284.wav|It's not a small step.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_285.wav|They have the cash and the fire power.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_286.wav|The institute board will take the decision.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_287.wav|He followed the Italian route.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_288.wav|If not, a deal could take many months.)|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_289.wav|You have made your point.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_290.wav|He died the following year.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_291.wav|We must move on.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_292.wav|It's just an area of water.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_293.wav|Rangers was on the agenda and I am interested.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_294.wav|If so, we want to hear from them.)|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_295.wav|She doesn't know the half of it.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_296.wav|Perhaps they were right.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_297.wav|Autumn will be a real challenge.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_298.wav|Many events are down on numbers.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_299.wav|He had served his time.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_300.wav|That was around July, August.)|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_301.wav|The direct effects on trade will be limited.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_302.wav|It changed the very language.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_303.wav|It was finally agreed on Saturday.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_304.wav|I did so, making the positive case for Scottish New Labour.)|37,,,
wav48/p264/p264_305.wav|Only one got through.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_306.wav|He remains a main board director of Royal.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_307.wav|It's not a marketing scheme.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_308.wav|There was no consultation with the executive and no need for any such consultation.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_309.wav|Five years ago its return was rejected.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_310.wav|He left pretty quickly.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_311.wav|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_312.wav|They might surprise themselves.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_313.wav|It is his speed off the mark that is so impressive.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_314.wav|Hibs are playing with style now.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_315.wav|Such a policy is for long-term strength.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_316.wav|This is extremely positive news.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_317.wav|Other teams moved up too.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_318.wav|I just felt like a dead loss.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_319.wav|Not one person spoke badly.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_320.wav|The performance continues to improve.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_321.wav|We want immediate action.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_322.wav|Our relationship has been very good.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_323.wav|Someone should tell them.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_324.wav|They really had a go at us.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_325.wav|They should try to get tickets.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_326.wav|The change could come as soon as September.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_327.wav|They emerged before the patients left hospital.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_328.wav|He did not say that.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_329.wav|We are a husband and wife team.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_330.wav|I can't get away from it.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_331.wav|He had played very well.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_332.wav|Sources yesterday said the Royal Bank has declined to back him.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_333.wav|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_334.wav|I saw one man vote five times.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_335.wav|It's quite crucial for me.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_336.wav|This fact is supported by audience research.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_337.wav|The regional government faces key elections next May.)|37,,,,
wav48/p264/p264_339.wav|Time remains to put other candidates forward.)|37,,,,

wav48/p265/p265_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |38,,
wav48/p265/p265_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |38,,
wav48/p265/p265_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|38,,
wav48/p265/p265_025.wav|Is this accurate?|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_026.wav|However, the following year the cancer returned.|38,,,

wav48/p265/p265_100.wav|The cause of the fire is not yet known.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_101.wav|I was just appalled at the way they behaved.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_102.wav|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.|38,,,

wav48/p265/p265_104.wav|It's a shame.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_105.wav|It was the eighties.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_106.wav|I did not see any reason to change the captain.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_107.wav|You had better believe it.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_108.wav|It is rubbish.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_109.wav|Who would be a referee?|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_110.wav|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.|38,,,,

wav48/p265/p265_120.wav|We work well together.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_121.wav|What will happen then?|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_122.wav|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_123.wav|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.|38,,,,

wav48/p265/p265_132.wav|He realises his mistake.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_133.wav|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_134.wav|The idea is simple.|38,,,,

wav48/p265/p265_146.wav|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.|38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_147.wav|Well, he should know.|38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_148.wav|I will tell you.|38,,,,

wav48/p265/p265_154.wav|It is not like us.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_155.wav|Seven people were later detained by police.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_156.wav|By then, however, both men were already in the US.|38,,

wav48/p265/p265_162.wav|Blair's response was weak.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_163.wav|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_164.wav|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.|38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_165.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_166.wav|He deserved the win.|38,,,,

wav48/p265/p265_170.wav|I've been there.|38,,,,

wav48/p265/p265_176.wav|I saw military vehicles in the distance.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_177.wav|Does this matter?|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_178.wav|One was a lawyer.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_179.wav|I put the drawing down.|38,,,,

wav48/p265/p265_181.wav|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.|38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_182.wav|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_183.wav|It is a farce.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_184.wav|Peace was won.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_185.wav|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.|38,,
wav48/p265/p265_186.wav|It was very frightened and dirty.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_187.wav|Is that success?|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_188.wav|The service from the other players was super.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_189.wav|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.|38,,,

wav48/p265/p265_194.wav|It's all about money, money, money.|38,,
wav48/p265/p265_195.wav|It was worth a photograph.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_196.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.|38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_197.wav|I don't want to use it.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_198.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_199.wav|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.|38,,
wav48/p265/p265_200.wav|I had decided to quit the show.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_201.wav|People must remain vigilant.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_202.wav|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.|38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_203.wav|He seemed to lose his focus.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_204.wav|I might come back.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_205.wav|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_206.wav|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_207.wav|Because they didn't want to know.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_208.wav|That has been the easy part.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_209.wav|But she was.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_210.wav|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_211.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.|38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_212.wav|I'd never seen a play about me.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_213.wav|It's not before time.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_214.wav|The report is due out next month.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_215.wav|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_216.wav|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.|38,,
wav48/p265/p265_217.wav|At the time, he was a living legend.|38,,,

wav48/p265/p265_219.wav|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_220.wav|We were awful.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_221.wav|We are so proud.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_222.wav|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.|38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_223.wav|I can leave at the end of the day.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_224.wav|Until they came to do it.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_225.wav|Half of young people had had contact with the police.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_226.wav|Wealth is relative.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_227.wav|Well, they were the unlucky ones.|38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_228.wav|You should be.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_229.wav|It's quite nice.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_230.wav|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.|38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_231.wav|It would still have been a good film, but very different.|38,,,

wav48/p265/p265_233.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_234.wav|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.|38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_235.wav|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_236.wav|I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_237.wav|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.|38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_238.wav|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_239.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.|38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_240.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.|38,,
wav48/p265/p265_241.wav|It was a hit.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_242.wav|There's the mix.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_243.wav|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_244.wav|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_245.wav|That could be in place by next year.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_246.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.|38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_247.wav|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_248.wav|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.|38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_249.wav|Chelsea was a great club.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_250.wav|We have to expand.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_251.wav|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_252.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.|38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_253.wav|Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_254.wav|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.|38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_255.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_256.wav|Souter will be back.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_257.wav|I am just trying to do my job.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_258.wav|Blood samples were taken.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_259.wav|They want to shut the Scottish Office.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_260.wav|This is a question of Islam.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_262.wav|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.|38,,
wav48/p265/p265_263.wav|It's a way of life.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_264.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_265.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.|38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_266.wav|They seem to get away with it.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_267.wav|The record companies have gone through the floor.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_268.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.|38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_269.wav|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.|38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_270.wav|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_271.wav|We have to break that cycle.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_272.wav|He looked very sharp.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_273.wav|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_274.wav|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.|38,,
wav48/p265/p265_275.wav|You've got to have both sides.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_276.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_277.wav|Dialogue is the key.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_278.wav|It was a virus.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_279.wav|Yet, it worked.|38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_280.wav|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_281.wav|This is a national crisis.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_282.wav|Who did the recruiting?|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_283.wav|So I did.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_284.wav|We are not going to forget.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_285.wav|What has altered?|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_286.wav|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_287.wav|There is no openness.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_288.wav|I can live with it.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_289.wav|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.|38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_290.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.|38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_291.wav|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.|38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_292.wav|Last night was a key episode.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_293.wav|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_294.wav|You are the glory.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_295.wav|The minister is the engineer.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_296.wav|The letters are going out today.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_297.wav|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way around.|38,,
wav48/p265/p265_298.wav|Is there on his hands?|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_299.wav|We are a peaceful people.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_300.wav|Kids are terrible.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_301.wav|Horses are drawn by ballot.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_302.wav|My body is clearly capable.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_303.wav|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_304.wav|They had a confession.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_305.wav|It will work.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_306.wav|I came into this world with nothing.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_307.wav|It's too horrible to think.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_308.wav|Either team will be hard.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_309.wav|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_310.wav|My view has now completely changed.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_311.wav|The party is up for it.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_312.wav|Is that an issue?|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_313.wav|Finally, he paid for the movie.|38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_314.wav|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.|38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_315.wav|The same things will happen with GM foods.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_316.wav|Who will do it?|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_317.wav|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_318.wav|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.|38,,
wav48/p265/p265_319.wav|Two people were interviewed.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_320.wav|I'm very lucky.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_321.wav|It's very good.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_322.wav|This is a friendly match?|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_323.wav|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.|38,,,,

wav48/p265/p265_328.wav|She said they would appeal.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_329.wav|But we finished the show.|38,,,,

wav48/p265/p265_342.wav|There was a substantial explosion.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_343.wav|It's not pretty, but it's effective.|38,,,
wav48/p265/p265_344.wav|He could face a jail sentence.|38,,,,
wav48/p265/p265_345.wav|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.|38,,,

wav48/p266/p266_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |39,,
wav48/p266/p266_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |39,,
wav48/p266/p266_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |39,,
wav48/p266/p266_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |39,,
wav48/p266/p266_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|39,,
wav48/p266/p266_025.wav|She looked so young.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_026.wav|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_027.wav|Is this accurate?|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_028.wav|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|39,,
wav48/p266/p266_029.wav|There's a story, too.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_030.wav|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_031.wav|Then, suddenly, they weren't.|39,,
wav48/p266/p266_032.wav|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_033.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_034.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.|39,,,

wav48/p266/p266_053.wav|I expect a rapid response.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_054.wav|What was the main difference?|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_055.wav|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_056.wav|They're appalled by that.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_057.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.|39,,,

wav48/p266/p266_083.wav|He seems to be pleased with the picture.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_084.wav|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_085.wav|Someone who cares|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_086.wav|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.|39,,,,

wav48/p266/p266_206.wav|It's not before time.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_207.wav|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_208.wav|We want to keep the pound.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_209.wav|I was so nervous.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_210.wav|He seemed to lose his focus.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_211.wav|Work has started.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_212.wav|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_213.wav|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_214.wav|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_215.wav|During the communist time they were very privileged.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_216.wav|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_217.wav|Saturday is gone.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_218.wav|Because they didn't want to know.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_219.wav|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_220.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_221.wav|Clearly, the stakes are high.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_222.wav|I will win.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_223.wav|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_224.wav|The report is due out next month.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_225.wav|We were awful.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_226.wav|They tried to give her advice.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_227.wav|They have now become the focus of a huge police inquiry.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_228.wav|They will be stopped, and they will be punished.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_229.wav|Half of young people had had contact with the police.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_230.wav|There is no excuse.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_231.wav|It's quite nice.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_232.wav|It would still have been a good film, but very different.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_233.wav|Of further privacy, he had no need.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_234.wav|It's a killer piece.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_235.wav|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_236.wav|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_237.wav|It is hard won.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_238.wav|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_239.wav|You can feel at home in China.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_240.wav|The scene is about this?|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_241.wav|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_242.wav|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_243.wav|My son was too young to die.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_244.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_245.wav|I should think so, too.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_246.wav|It was a hit.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_247.wav|There's the mix.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_248.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_249.wav|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.|39,,
wav48/p266/p266_250.wav|We are in a war.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_251.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_252.wav|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_253.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_254.wav|It was like the old days.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_255.wav|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_256.wav|Chelsea was a great club.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_257.wav|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_258.wav|We have to expand.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_259.wav|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_260.wav|Souter will be back.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_261.wav|Note the date.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_262.wav|It will be done in stages.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_263.wav|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_264.wav|You take a risk.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_265.wav|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_266.wav|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_267.wav|He was also married with two children.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_268.wav|The system can work.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_269.wav|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_270.wav|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_271.wav|We're in shock.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_272.wav|Our objective is to tackle poverty.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_273.wav|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.|39,,
wav48/p266/p266_274.wav|That goes back a long way.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_275.wav|It was very fast.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_276.wav|She failed in her action.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_277.wav|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_278.wav|They seem to get away with it.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_279.wav|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_280.wav|It's so awful.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_281.wav|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_282.wav|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_283.wav|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_284.wav|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_285.wav|Dialogue is the key.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_286.wav|They have shown a great desire and attitude.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_287.wav|Tony Blair said as little.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_288.wav|She is an expert on medical ethics.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_289.wav|It was good.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_290.wav|Who did the recruiting?|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_291.wav|Bombing slaughter rejected|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_292.wav|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_293.wav|It could well be military.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_294.wav|No Briton has ever won.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_295.wav|Robin Williams is very subdued.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_296.wav|Spent three months alone at sea.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_297.wav|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_298.wav|There was a vacuum.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_299.wav|We lost a boy.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_300.wav|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_301.wav|I was brought up in a mining background.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_302.wav|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_303.wav|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_304.wav|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_305.wav|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_306.wav|I can give no comment.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_307.wav|But the military campaign is a military campaign against Osama bin Laden.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_308.wav|This is a war over our home.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_309.wav|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_310.wav|The plot is minimal.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_311.wav|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_312.wav|You should be.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_313.wav|The minister is the engineer.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_314.wav|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_315.wav|We have got no money to go anywhere.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_316.wav|Your father was a good man.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_317.wav|We are a peaceful people.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_318.wav|You may have a short memory.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_319.wav|The problems began a long time ago.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_320.wav|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_321.wav|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_322.wav|A review is under way.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_323.wav|We are in the end game.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_324.wav|It's too horrible to think.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_325.wav|The airport was even different.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_326.wav|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_327.wav|There was no time scale.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_328.wav|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_329.wav|Is there a new way forward?|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_330.wav|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_331.wav|Finally, he paid for the movie.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_332.wav|However, they will only be found in the wild.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_333.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_334.wav|Who will do it?|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_335.wav|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.|39,,
wav48/p266/p266_336.wav|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_337.wav|Two people were interviewed.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_338.wav|We've tried every other way.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_339.wav|This is a big advantage.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_340.wav|Maloney was asked.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_341.wav|But I was knocked out by the city.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_342.wav|went on sale.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_343.wav|I'm very lucky.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_344.wav|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.|39,,
wav48/p266/p266_345.wav|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_346.wav|It is long gone.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_347.wav|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_348.wav|Tell us about it.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_349.wav|There may be reasons for it.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_350.wav|I believe the gap is nearly there.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_351.wav|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_352.wav|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.|39,,
wav48/p266/p266_353.wav|She is free.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_354.wav|Both of those promises have already been honoured.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_355.wav|You must have a government and a good civil service.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_356.wav|Yet he left a few days later.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_357.wav|You have to rely on each other.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_358.wav|It was one in the afternoon.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_359.wav|We will be homeless.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_360.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_361.wav|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_362.wav|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_363.wav|This is a club on the rise.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_364.wav|Not so, it seems.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_365.wav|He was also a great man.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_366.wav|He could make it.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_367.wav|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_368.wav|He has been in a nursing home for two years.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_369.wav|It's now down in black and white.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_370.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_371.wav|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_372.wav|It is a simple equation.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_373.wav|So there, we won.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_374.wav|But I managed.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_375.wav|By that time, however, it was already too late.|39,,
wav48/p266/p266_376.wav|There is no signature.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_377.wav|The task is enormous.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_378.wav|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_379.wav|I am a wealthy person.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_380.wav|Colour was at the core of his life.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_381.wav|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.|39,,
wav48/p266/p266_382.wav|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_384.wav|It's like a car crash.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_385.wav|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_386.wav|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_387.wav|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.|39,,
wav48/p266/p266_388.wav|Does that put pressure on us?|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_389.wav|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_390.wav|It is unusual.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_391.wav|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_392.wav|A parliament for England is the only way to redress the balance.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_393.wav|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.|39,,
wav48/p266/p266_394.wav|They are good.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_395.wav|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_396.wav|It was a breathtaking moment.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_397.wav|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.|39,,
wav48/p266/p266_398.wav|What happened in the summer?|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_399.wav|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_400.wav|But, in fact, the reverse is true.|39,,
wav48/p266/p266_401.wav|Emotions were complex.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_402.wav|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_403.wav|So I did.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_404.wav|It's an absolute nonsense.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_405.wav|I knew the script.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_406.wav|They were kept there for a summer.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_407.wav|The weekly average was three hours.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_408.wav|Relief was beyond belief.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_409.wav|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_410.wav|He got his degree.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_411.wav|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_412.wav|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_413.wav|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.|39,,,
wav48/p266/p266_414.wav|But we finished the show.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_415.wav|He was really great.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_416.wav|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_417.wav|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_418.wav|That may be.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_419.wav|It is legally binding.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_420.wav|Paris is not only young.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_421.wav|Such as it is.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_422.wav|It looked like a war zone.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_423.wav|I've invented a village in East Lothian.|39,,,,
wav48/p266/p266_424.wav|I chose to make a film.|39,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_001.wav|Please call Stella. |40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |40,,
wav48/p267/p267_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |40,,
wav48/p267/p267_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |40,,
wav48/p267/p267_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows. |40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |40,,
wav48/p267/p267_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|40,,
wav48/p267/p267_025.wav|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_026.wav|He may not need to force that message.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_027.wav|There is no reason at all.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_028.wav|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_029.wav|Because we do not need it.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_030.wav|We will look into it.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_031.wav|This is a central issue.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_032.wav|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_033.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.|40,,
wav48/p267/p267_034.wav|I became a widow overnight.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_035.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_036.wav|A week is a long time in politics.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_037.wav|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_038.wav|This represents a tough game for us.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_039.wav|She hopes to study in Britain one day.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_040.wav|It is difficult for Ali.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_041.wav|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_042.wav|He is too weak to move.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_043.wav|Everything else is a bonus.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_044.wav|This is the interesting part.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_045.wav|I guess I was lucky, though.|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_046.wav|Pulled a huge number of viewers.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_047.wav|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_048.wav|There was no safety net.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_049.wav|They just thought it was extremely good acting.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_050.wav|It is a different animal.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_051.wav|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_052.wav|I must take a seat.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_053.wav|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_054.wav|Four other charges were dropped.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_055.wav|So I liked the challenge.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_056.wav|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_057.wav|That way I won't have to do anything.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_058.wav|It's just the timing of the game.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_059.wav|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_060.wav|We need to increase the membership.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_061.wav|He was at home with his pals.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_062.wav|They are in the euro.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_063.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_064.wav|How are you, sir ?|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_065.wav|So is that it, then ?|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_066.wav|Do I have a favourite ?|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_067.wav|There could be a way back.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_068.wav|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_069.wav|Her body was found on Monday morning.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_070.wav|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.|40,,,,

wav48/p267/p267_072.wav|A government is a government is a government.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_073.wav|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_074.wav|That is bound to happen.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_075.wav|He is in the queue.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_076.wav|He seems to be pleased with the picture.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_077.wav|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_078.wav|He can win every week.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_079.wav|By then, he was walking on water.|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_080.wav|It's so hard to shift.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_081.wav|They lived for their children.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_082.wav|The cut is excellent news for the consumer.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_083.wav|There was no way back for United after that.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_084.wav|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_085.wav|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_086.wav|They need to find a form of words.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_087.wav|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_088.wav|It's for that reason he should resign.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_089.wav|The rescue package is public money.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_090.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_091.wav|Our house was very small.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_092.wav|They were a lovely couple.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_093.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_094.wav|It's not a lack of effort.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_095.wav|That means an extra two years.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_096.wav|Then came the collision with Sergio.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_097.wav|It is a total and utter change of culture.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_098.wav|Sport is good for you.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_099.wav|We need to handle it.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_100.wav|They will notice a difference.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_102.wav|Such actions are rarely popular.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_103.wav|He has done that with a great deal to spare.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_104.wav|Then again, we could have.|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_105.wav|She's got to say something.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_106.wav|I was always a little behind.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_107.wav|There were no grounds for his action.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_108.wav|That admission is not surprising.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_109.wav|We have a training class.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_110.wav|Well, you can have a tree.|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_111.wav|Becoming a father was wonderful.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_112.wav|I was on a roll.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_113.wav|What do we do ?|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_114.wav|Why do it otherwise ?|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_115.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_116.wav|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_117.wav|Something will be done by corporate bodies.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_118.wav|We did what we had to do.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_119.wav|I am the Son of Sam.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_120.wav|You've got to be vigilant.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_121.wav|Tiger is not the norm.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_122.wav|My conscience is not clear.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_123.wav|Nobody in the world can get away from him.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_124.wav|It would make a lot of sense.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_125.wav|They could use a boost.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_126.wav|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_127.wav|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.|40,,

wav48/p267/p267_129.wav|He was seen as the enemy.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_130.wav|That group reported just before Christmas.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_131.wav|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_132.wav|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_133.wav|It was a piece of art.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_134.wav|I am just trying to do my job.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_135.wav|So I got a blood test.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_136.wav|It has become a way of life.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_137.wav|I was caught out a little bit.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_138.wav|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_139.wav|It has to be an event.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_140.wav|It was deployed in the Gulf War.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_141.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.|40,,
wav48/p267/p267_142.wav|She had gone to the Catholic school.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_143.wav|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_144.wav|It was by the numbers.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_145.wav|We will turn the corner.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_146.wav|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.|40,,
wav48/p267/p267_147.wav|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_148.wav|There was a definite prejudice.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_149.wav|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_150.wav|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_151.wav|Adams is surely worth a chance.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_152.wav|That is not too bad.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_153.wav|We are still getting over it.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_154.wav|As, indeed, they would be.|40,,
wav48/p267/p267_155.wav|We came across the first set of bodies.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_156.wav|Seven people were later detained by police.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_157.wav|I would probably have to agree with him.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_158.wav|We were given a warm and friendly reception.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_159.wav|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_160.wav|Nobody did in those days.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_161.wav|So what is the campaign about ?|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_162.wav|And does it ?|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_163.wav|Are you from the rugby ?|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_164.wav|Had I heard ?|40,,,,

wav48/p267/p267_166.wav|It's nice to be nice.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_167.wav|The people are the hero.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_168.wav|I always felt they played for me.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_169.wav|It is premature to speculate on the impact.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_170.wav|They made such decisions in London.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_171.wav|It is a body blow.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_172.wav|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_173.wav|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_174.wav|It is not a threat.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_175.wav|I would not count on it.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_176.wav|He played it like a veteran.|40,,,,

wav48/p267/p267_180.wav|They need to look after themselves.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_181.wav|It is a common problem.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_182.wav|A team is a team.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_183.wav|Aberdeen had little to offer.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_184.wav|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_185.wav|It was a pre-emptive strike.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_186.wav|A terrorist is a terrorist.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_187.wav|People will ask about us.|40,,,,

wav48/p267/p267_202.wav|It is an impressive record.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_203.wav|There is no quick fix.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_204.wav|Abbey National is an option.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_205.wav|It has been like that all year for me.|40,,,,

wav48/p267/p267_209.wav|I had relied on him.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_210.wav|The course has helped a lot.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_211.wav|I'm just a regular person.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_212.wav|My life is in the ballet.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_213.wav|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_214.wav|They're going to open in early summer.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_215.wav|Anyway, the job will be part-time.|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_216.wav|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_217.wav|It is good for our team.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_218.wav|It was a crazy day.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_219.wav|Edinburgh was not included in the survey.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_220.wav|Because they didn't want to know.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_221.wav|Women were mostly notable by their absence.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_222.wav|You have to do your research.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_223.wav|What do we want to do that for ?|40,,,,

wav48/p267/p267_249.wav|He declined to give any details.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_250.wav|It seems a waste of talents.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_251.wav|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_252.wav|If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_253.wav|His is a global perspective.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_254.wav|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.|40,,,,

wav48/p267/p267_270.wav|It is also very valuable.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_271.wav|It disappeared into the cup.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_272.wav|The stage was set for a showdown.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_273.wav|Not many companies can say that these days.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_274.wav|He will emerge as a world leader.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_275.wav|We're trying to get rounded performers.|40,,,,

wav48/p267/p267_284.wav|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_285.wav|That goes back a long way.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_286.wav|And they were being paid ?|40,,,,

wav48/p267/p267_297.wav|The attacker died in the crash.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_298.wav|It is inherent in society.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_299.wav|He refused to name the survivors.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_300.wav|It's difficult to predict the future.|40,,,,

wav48/p267/p267_330.wav|The election is total confusion and chaos.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_331.wav|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_332.wav|The problems began a long time ago.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_333.wav|It makes a compelling display.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_334.wav|That is a trend which will be encouraged.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_335.wav|But the New Year was special.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_336.wav|They are now out in the cold.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_337.wav|There was no time scale.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_338.wav|Does that put pressure on us ?|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_339.wav|Did it work ?|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_340.wav|Do you think we are a top nation ?|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_341.wav|It was tough to contain the excitement.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_342.wav|It is a strong case.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_343.wav|A report is expected next month.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_344.wav|The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_345.wav|They were the acts of men.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_346.wav|It wasn't a flight of fancy.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_347.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_348.wav|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_349.wav|He is not very big, either.|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_350.wav|I have a moral dilemma.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_351.wav|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_352.wav|Finally, he paid for the movie.|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_353.wav|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_354.wav|Some will be deployed on submarines.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_355.wav|He did a good job.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_356.wav|It intends to do so on Wednesday.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_357.wav|It is a stroke of genius.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_358.wav|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_359.wav|We live on an island.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_360.wav|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_361.wav|They have created a business.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_362.wav|I got a yellow card.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_363.wav|I am considered a teenager.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_364.wav|There may be reasons for it.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_365.wav|This is a major championship.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_366.wav|It's only a matter of scale.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_367.wav|She is now on the back benches.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_368.wav|They were to blame for the first two goals.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_369.wav|There is no deal as yet.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_370.wav|You must have a government and a good civil service.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_371.wav|to have products for their needs.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_372.wav|The pair are very much in love.|40,,,,

wav48/p267/p267_376.wav|The seller was not revealed.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_377.wav|People are on the alert.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_378.wav|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.|40,,
wav48/p267/p267_379.wav|In fact, he was great today.|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_380.wav|We operate as a Scottish company.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_381.wav|He has been in a nursing home for two years.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_382.wav|A review is under way.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_383.wav|They have not done so this season so far.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_384.wav|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_385.wav|Safety was also an issue.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_386.wav|We have made no final decisions.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_387.wav|They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_388.wav|The results will take second place.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_389.wav|It was a funny game.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_390.wav|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_391.wav|It does not even have a staff shortage.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_392.wav|The Cabinet is split over the issue.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_393.wav|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_394.wav|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_395.wav|We shall not be moved.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_396.wav|I watch the other visitors.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_397.wav|I remain a buyer of the shares.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_398.wav|There were no plans for a rights issue.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_399.wav|That's all I can say.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_400.wav|Are they free ?|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_401.wav|What are they for ?|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_402.wav|Is there a waiting list ?|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_403.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_404.wav|You thought it was a headache.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_405.wav|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_406.wav|I thought he was an animal.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_407.wav|None of the agencies was able to help.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_408.wav|We will stand for the nation.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_409.wav|I'm pleased about one thing.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_410.wav|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_411.wav|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_412.wav|My aim is a top six finish.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_413.wav|Such an attack is bizarre.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_414.wav|These guys are looking for business.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_415.wav|He is on the wrong side.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_416.wav|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.|40,,,
wav48/p267/p267_417.wav|This is no reflection on Rangers.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_418.wav|Further new equity was raised in a placing in January.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_419.wav|It needs to be volatile.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_420.wav|I've got my own ideas.|40,,,,
wav48/p267/p267_421.wav|Nobody should believe this story.|40,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_001.wav|Please call Stella. |41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |41,,
wav48/p268/p268_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |41,,,
wav48/p268/p268_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |41,,,
wav48/p268/p268_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |41,,
wav48/p268/p268_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |41,,,
wav48/p268/p268_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |41,,,
wav48/p268/p268_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |41,,,
wav48/p268/p268_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |41,,,
wav48/p268/p268_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|41,,
wav48/p268/p268_025.wav|They might have asked, for goodness sake.|41,,,
wav48/p268/p268_026.wav|He got very close tonight.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_027.wav|Smoking is also very important.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_028.wav|Wages and salaries account for a major proportion of our expenses.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_029.wav|The first appeared to be successful.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_030.wav|We must convince the citizens.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_031.wav|Carlton also declined to comment last night.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_032.wav|She is employed on short-term contracts.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_033.wav|Further management changes are planned.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_034.wav|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.|41,,,
wav48/p268/p268_035.wav|It's as we were yesterday.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_036.wav|We are opening an inquiry.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_037.wav|He works at the airport.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_038.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_039.wav|How are you, sir ?|41,,,
wav48/p268/p268_040.wav|So is that it, then ?|41,,,
wav48/p268/p268_041.wav|Do I have a favourite ?|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_042.wav|What do we do ?|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_043.wav|Why do it otherwise ?|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_044.wav|However, the purchase is as yet unproven.|41,,,
wav48/p268/p268_045.wav|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_046.wav|Something has to give sometime.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_047.wav|Her husband had been waiting for her return.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_048.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_049.wav|The latter option was chosen.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_050.wav|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_051.wav|The man became a reporter.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_052.wav|Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_053.wav|The thought of playing in the English Premiership has tremendous appeal.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_054.wav|Among them are many criminals.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_055.wav|I knew my contract was up this year.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_056.wav|The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_057.wav|But it couldn't happen overnight.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_058.wav|It was just too much for us.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_059.wav|Perhaps we should do the same.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_060.wav|They desperately want some stability.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_061.wav|Everything is possible in football.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_062.wav|He looks like an Afghan.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_063.wav|This trend is likely to strengthen.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_064.wav|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_065.wav|He will need that machine.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_066.wav|Debate was impassioned and furious.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_067.wav|I would not say that.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_068.wav|This was a far cry from his election pledges.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_069.wav|Pulled a huge number of viewers.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_070.wav|The regional newspapers have outperformed the national titles.|41,,,,

wav48/p268/p268_074.wav|I am relishing the challenge.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_075.wav|Let's hope that it does.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_076.wav|But the organisers refused to worry.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_077.wav|We have to keep our clients.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_078.wav|We should be able to cope.|41,,,,

wav48/p268/p268_203.wav|There was a fine line to tread.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_204.wav|The refund is fully justified.|41,,,,

wav48/p268/p268_219.wav|We had to add value.|41,,,,

wav48/p268/p268_229.wav|For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.|41,,,
wav48/p268/p268_230.wav|That proved enough to settle the home side down.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_231.wav|Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_232.wav|Years ago it was really quite simple.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_233.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.|41,,

wav48/p268/p268_240.wav|Do you think we are a top nation ?|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_241.wav|It would seem a natural progression.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_242.wav|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.|41,,,
wav48/p268/p268_243.wav|We will turn the corner.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_244.wav|Of course, it is a tough assignment.|41,,,
wav48/p268/p268_245.wav|There was no basis for their arrest.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_246.wav|This wasn't just a big crowd.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_247.wav|The best thing for me was to join the Army.|41,,,,

wav48/p268/p268_259.wav|Her political persuasion is no secret.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_260.wav|We have a budget in March.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_261.wav|The Dutchman was pleased with the result.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_262.wav|You had to go and see him.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_263.wav|The shoppers knew it before City investors did.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_264.wav|The planning appears to have paid off.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_265.wav|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_266.wav|We believe in the medium term.|41,,,,

wav48/p268/p268_275.wav|They made such decisions in London.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_276.wav|Clearly, they had other problems.|41,,,
wav48/p268/p268_277.wav|First, the programme was unbalanced.|41,,,
wav48/p268/p268_278.wav|The happiness was slightly misplaced.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_279.wav|Phase one was a shambles.|41,,,,
wav48/p268/p268_280.wav|If that's the case, he will struggle.|41,,,

wav48/p269/p269_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |42,,
wav48/p269/p269_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |42,,

wav48/p269/p269_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drop increases. |42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of the number of bows. |42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |42,,
wav48/p269/p269_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|42,,

wav48/p269/p269_153.wav|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_154.wav|It's like a football team.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_155.wav|It would be a last resort.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_156.wav|That group reported just before Christmas.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_157.wav|He will emerge as a world leader.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_158.wav|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_159.wav|I was so nervous.|42,,,,

wav48/p269/p269_161.wav|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_162.wav|His death was a tragic accident.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_163.wav|This latter point is hugely important.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_164.wav|It is so unfair.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_165.wav|It is an attitude of mind.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_166.wav|I've put my own money into this project.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_167.wav|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_168.wav|I am now unemployed.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_169.wav|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_170.wav|We have to move forward.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_171.wav|We knew we had the goal we wanted.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_172.wav|I lost my head.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_173.wav|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_174.wav|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.|42,,,,

wav48/p269/p269_176.wav|They thought they had found a home.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_177.wav|His team management was protective.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_179.wav|But the petrol station does not get the benefit.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_180.wav|It was a great achievement to win at Wembley.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_181.wav|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_182.wav|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.|42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_183.wav|Everyone can be bought.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_184.wav|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_185.wav|They know no other way.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_186.wav|It's an idea.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_187.wav|They will run a mile.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_188.wav|Four policemen were wounded.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_189.wav|We did everything by the book.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_190.wav|Does this matter?|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_191.wav|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_193.wav|It had been in place since last July.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_194.wav|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.|42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_195.wav|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_196.wav|We must keep our feet on the ground.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_197.wav|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_198.wav|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_199.wav|The conference is the first test.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_200.wav|We played them off the pitch.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_201.wav|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_202.wav|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.|42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_203.wav|It was good fun.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_204.wav|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_205.wav|It's all about money, money, money.|42,,
wav48/p269/p269_206.wav|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.|42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_207.wav|I had been at the Evening Standard for two years.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_208.wav|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.|42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_209.wav|But I am a worried man.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_210.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_211.wav|Saddam Hussein is a devil.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_212.wav|Feel the heat?|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_213.wav|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_214.wav|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.|42,,
wav48/p269/p269_215.wav|I began to pray.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_216.wav|I am delighted for Simon.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_217.wav|It had all been arranged.|42,,,,

wav48/p269/p269_224.wav|Who was on the panel?|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_225.wav|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.|42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_226.wav|It's so special.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_227.wav|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_228.wav|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.|42,,,,

wav48/p269/p269_230.wav|I'd never seen a play about me.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_231.wav|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_232.wav|My neighbours are horrified.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_233.wav|But she was.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_234.wav|It's like a basketball.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_235.wav|And thought we would get away with it.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_236.wav|Of course, that is not the whole story.|42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_237.wav|Half of young people had had contact with the police.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_238.wav|Well, they were the unlucky ones.|42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_239.wav|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_240.wav|It's quite nice.|42,,,,

wav48/p269/p269_243.wav|It would still have been a good film, but very different.|42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_244.wav|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.|42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_245.wav|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_246.wav|I know I'm in a very special position.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_247.wav|You can feel at home in China.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_248.wav|Some families have even requested to leave the city.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_249.wav|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_250.wav|It's a record label, not a form of music.|42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_251.wav|I was shocked.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_252.wav|I should think so, too.|42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_253.wav|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_254.wav|Her presence was almost everywhere.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_255.wav|I can't get a job.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_256.wav|It is nearly there.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_257.wav|Special measures were needed.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_258.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.|42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_259.wav|The distinction is also supported by doctors.|42,,,,

wav48/p269/p269_261.wav|Kirkwood was arrested.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_263.wav|I am very angry.|42,,,,

wav48/p269/p269_265.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_266.wav|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_267.wav|The warning is timely.|42,,,,

wav48/p269/p269_272.wav|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.|42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_273.wav|It left me with a sadness.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_274.wav|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_275.wav|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.|42,,,,

wav48/p269/p269_277.wav|They wanted the club to make money.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_278.wav|It's a way of life.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_279.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_280.wav|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_281.wav|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_282.wav|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.|42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_283.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.|42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_284.wav|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.|42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_285.wav|It happens from time to time.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_286.wav|If not, he should go home.|42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_287.wav|They were too hard.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_288.wav|I saw it at a ruck.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_289.wav|I intended to look for another club on loan.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_290.wav|You've got to have both sides.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_291.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_292.wav|It was a virus.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_293.wav|Who will perform?|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_294.wav|It's like a high school play.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_295.wav|This is a national crisis.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_296.wav|I feel really sorry for the Iraqi people.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_297.wav|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_298.wav|Police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_299.wav|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_300.wav|It changed my life.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_301.wav|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_302.wav|Sunday's game was not a trial.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_303.wav|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.|42,,,

wav48/p269/p269_308.wav|Graeme was prepared.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_309.wav|However, the snow was welcomed by some.|42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_310.wav|But it's a subtle process.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_311.wav|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_312.wav|There is no openness.|42,,,,

wav48/p269/p269_314.wav|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_315.wav|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_316.wav|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.|42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_317.wav|It's just not funny!|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_318.wav|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_319.wav|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_320.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.|42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_321.wav|SCOTLAND has shown the way.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_322.wav|I did not name it.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_323.wav|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_324.wav|We have got no money to go anywhere.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_325.wav|This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_326.wav|It's about my time as a guitarist.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_327.wav|I was rubbish.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_328.wav|We are a peaceful people.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_329.wav|The election is total confusion and chaos.|42,,,,

wav48/p269/p269_334.wav|Referees are easy targets.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_335.wav|They had a confession.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_336.wav|In the old days, it was easy.|42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_337.wav|However, the groups denied the claims.|42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_338.wav|I came into this world with nothing.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_339.wav|That's the law of the land.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_340.wav|There was no time scale.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_341.wav|It is a strong case.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_342.wav|Is there a new way forward?|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_343.wav|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_344.wav|The boat was fantastic.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_345.wav|I'd like to take the plunge.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_346.wav|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_347.wav|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_348.wav|It's been hard.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_349.wav|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_350.wav|It is a sign of hope.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_352.wav|It has moved on in the last week.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_353.wav|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_354.wav|You feel the pride.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_355.wav|The train was on time.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_356.wav|It was so new, so exciting.|42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_357.wav|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_358.wav|A great deal has been achieved.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_359.wav|It was forced to divert.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_360.wav|It should be scrapped.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_361.wav|It is long gone.|42,,,,

wav48/p269/p269_363.wav|Tyson is overwhelmed.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_364.wav|As, indeed, they would be.|42,,
wav48/p269/p269_365.wav|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_366.wav|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_367.wav|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.|42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_368.wav|We will be homeless.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_369.wav|I expected these kind of questions.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_370.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.|42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_371.wav|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_372.wav|It's a true story.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_373.wav|All the investment is possible through the public sector.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_374.wav|He later became a respected High Court judge.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_375.wav|The play is based on a real-life event.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_376.wav|He could face a jail sentence.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_377.wav|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_378.wav|They have not done so this season so far.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_379.wav|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_380.wav|They play together perfectly.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_381.wav|It is a large number.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_382.wav|He could not be contacted for further comment yesterday.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_383.wav|They haven't got a hope.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_384.wav|It is obvious that we are engaged in a war.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_385.wav|He denied the charge.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_386.wav|You can cope with it.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_387.wav|I am very happy with life.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_388.wav|A young Briton had a lucky escape.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_389.wav|Treatment is not an issue with these people.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_391.wav|If you look at the other galleries in this area.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_392.wav|In Scotland, we keep the faith.|42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_393.wav|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.|42,,,
wav48/p269/p269_394.wav|I'm pleased about one thing.|42,,,,
wav48/p269/p269_395.wav|It is unusual.|42,,,,

wav48/p270/p270_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |43,,,
wav48/p270/p270_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |43,,
wav48/p270/p270_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |43,,
wav48/p270/p270_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |43,,,
wav48/p270/p270_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |43,,,
wav48/p270/p270_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |43,,,,

wav48/p270/p270_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |43,,,
wav48/p270/p270_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |43,,,
wav48/p270/p270_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |43,,
wav48/p270/p270_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.|43,,

wav48/p270/p270_097.wav|But the battle has only just begun.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_098.wav|In the end we made too many errors.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_099.wav|That time is not now, however.|43,,,
wav48/p270/p270_100.wav|The following are the principal provisions.|43,,,,

wav48/p270/p270_133.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_134.wav|So what happens next ?|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_135.wav|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_136.wav|But beyond a fairly minimal level it has little impact.|43,,,,

wav48/p270/p270_229.wav|I am considered a teenager.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_230.wav|There's a chance they might come down.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_231.wav|Yet the evidence is plain to see.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_232.wav|There was the option of following the Celtic to Portugal.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_233.wav|I wouldn't even respond to that question.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_234.wav|People should make their own decisions.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_235.wav|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_236.wav|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_237.wav|That was a real challenge.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_238.wav|His background is firmly in venture capital.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_239.wav|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_240.wav|We were a shambles at the back.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_241.wav|The scientific debate is dead.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_242.wav|They are the innocent victims.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_243.wav|You should always be able to get out in some direction.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_244.wav|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_245.wav|This would include the GM food industry.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_246.wav|And he goes with it.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_247.wav|It had so much to do with output.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_248.wav|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_249.wav|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_250.wav|The irony was not lost.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_251.wav|I might get an injury very easily.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_252.wav|It might be sad, but it's a fact.|43,,,
wav48/p270/p270_253.wav|Everything depends on the weather.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_254.wav|This is a historic occasion.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_255.wav|This championship is different from the other majors.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_256.wav|Labour was too busy to respond.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_257.wav|I was just getting over the time difference.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_258.wav|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_259.wav|Either way, the investor retains the premium.|43,,,
wav48/p270/p270_260.wav|There is no change in principle from the White Paper.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_261.wav|You're not getting any goodwill.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_262.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.|43,,
wav48/p270/p270_263.wav|No production contract is yet in sight.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_264.wav|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_265.wav|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_266.wav|We accept the new rules.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_267.wav|It is probably in the culture.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_268.wav|He took over our lives.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_269.wav|I'd never run for them.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_270.wav|how do you get it back ?|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_271.wav|What are you not good at ?|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_272.wav|I think, therefore I am ?|43,,,
wav48/p270/p270_273.wav|Who was she ?|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_274.wav|Or was it ?|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_275.wav|And they were being paid ?|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_276.wav|These figures are truly terrible.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_277.wav|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_278.wav|He could see no other bidder.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_279.wav|There's not much money in cycling.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_280.wav|None of this work is guaranteed.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_281.wav|This could put pressure on UK inflation.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_282.wav|Any error is severely punished.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_283.wav|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.|43,,,
wav48/p270/p270_284.wav|I understand the security issue.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_285.wav|It left me with a sadness.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_286.wav|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_287.wav|The target is to break even by Christmas.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_288.wav|It was never a free kick.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_289.wav|The manager's position was obviously included in that review.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_290.wav|It involved the same people.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_291.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.|43,,,
wav48/p270/p270_292.wav|You have to expect this type of thing.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_293.wav|There's always the next century.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_294.wav|It's hard to see it.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_295.wav|The partnership was set up during the summer.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_296.wav|Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_297.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_298.wav|I intended to look for another club on loan.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_299.wav|Maloney is an engaging talent.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_300.wav|We would hope to make progress on that next year.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_301.wav|The rescue package is public money.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_302.wav|He was overwhelmed by the response.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_303.wav|The effect was almost magical.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_304.wav|It would be great to win the title again.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_305.wav|It could well be military.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_306.wav|Selection is not in my hands at all.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_307.wav|His day had started much like any other Sunday.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_308.wav|The songs are just so good.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_309.wav|Sunday's game was not a trial.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_310.wav|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_311.wav|The world record is suspicious.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_312.wav|There was no hint of scandal.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_313.wav|I was brought up in a mining background.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_314.wav|Job losses were also announced.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_315.wav|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_316.wav|It is a road of death.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_317.wav|The pound has also suffered.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_318.wav|He has left the company.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_319.wav|What happened in that game ?|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_320.wav|Are you going to win ?|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_321.wav|Was it the wife ?|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_322.wav|Why change it ?|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_323.wav|What do we want to do that for ?|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_324.wav|Does the name matter ?|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_325.wav|People can really get themselves in a mess.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_326.wav|Survival is not an option.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_327.wav|There will be good prospects ahead.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_328.wav|Will have consequences for Scottish universities.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_329.wav|It is a court case.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_330.wav|This isn't the end of story.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_331.wav|It will set the tone.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_332.wav|He will go a long way.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_333.wav|It is far too early.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_334.wav|The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_335.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_336.wav|Age is not like other forms of discrimination.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_337.wav|The next week is crucial.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_338.wav|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_339.wav|My body is clearly capable.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_340.wav|It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_341.wav|There was some merit in that.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_342.wav|They were impressive against France.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_343.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?|43,,,
wav48/p270/p270_344.wav|So, did she meet him ?|43,,,
wav48/p270/p270_345.wav|So what is the campaign about ?|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_346.wav|And does it ?|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_347.wav|Are you from the rugby ?|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_348.wav|He declined to comment on possible disposals.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_349.wav|Nobody said it was required.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_350.wav|This statement has never been withdrawn.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_351.wav|It was tough to contain the excitement.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_352.wav|Whether this return was too soon.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_353.wav|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.|43,,,
wav48/p270/p270_354.wav|There is a good example in this city.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_355.wav|It's wonderful to have won.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_356.wav|He was at school in Devon.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_357.wav|This decision is a farce.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_358.wav|My view has now completely changed.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_359.wav|Finally, he paid for the movie.|43,,,
wav48/p270/p270_360.wav|We are satisfied with this outcome.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_361.wav|We have very limited capacity.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_362.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.|43,,,
wav48/p270/p270_363.wav|An alternative must be offered.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_364.wav|The value of the merger is still there.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_365.wav|Nobody else was with me.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_366.wav|My mind is focused on the next four weeks.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_367.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.|43,,,
wav48/p270/p270_368.wav|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_369.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_370.wav|But BA said the prediction was premature.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_371.wav|You need a licence to run a pub.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_372.wav|The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_373.wav|I came here this week to work.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_374.wav|They knew that I wanted to do something.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_375.wav|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_376.wav|He must have seen the movie.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_377.wav|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_378.wav|She said they would appeal.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_379.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_380.wav|How are you, sir ?|43,,,
wav48/p270/p270_381.wav|So is that it, then ?|43,,,
wav48/p270/p270_382.wav|What do we do ?|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_383.wav|They were to blame for the first two goals.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_384.wav|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_385.wav|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_386.wav|She is obviously very disappointed.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_387.wav|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.|43,,,
wav48/p270/p270_388.wav|Last season was very hard for me.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_389.wav|The parties include the Scottish Executive.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_390.wav|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_391.wav|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.|43,,,
wav48/p270/p270_392.wav|I always knew she was funny.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_393.wav|Glasgow University declined to comment.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_394.wav|It runs until the beginning of June.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_395.wav|It sounds like a wish list.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_396.wav|They have not got anyone.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_397.wav|It has happened for generations.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_398.wav|There was a substantial explosion.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_399.wav|Petrol prices were widely blamed.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_400.wav|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.|43,,,,

wav48/p270/p270_402.wav|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_403.wav|There's still no-one like him.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_404.wav|He put some colour into Scottish history.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_405.wav|Ferguson must take the blame.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_406.wav|It's too close to call.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_407.wav|The breakdown was much later in her life.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_408.wav|Of course, it is nonsense.|43,,,
wav48/p270/p270_409.wav|Colour was at the core of his life.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_410.wav|We must improve our relations with government.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_411.wav|That is the ultimate revenge.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_412.wav|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.|43,,,
wav48/p270/p270_413.wav|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_414.wav|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_415.wav|Shelter also supports the reform.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_416.wav|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_417.wav|That was a touch of class.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_418.wav|People will see this over time.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_419.wav|Surrey police said no body had been found.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_420.wav|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_421.wav|My aim is a top six finish.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_422.wav|Such an attack is bizarre.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_423.wav|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.|43,,,
wav48/p270/p270_424.wav|This is a huge boost for my confidence.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_425.wav|It was a breathtaking moment.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_426.wav|It needs to be volatile.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_427.wav|The need for any new UN resolutions will be put on hold.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_428.wav|The woman is basically off her head.|43,,,,

wav48/p270/p270_430.wav|Thomson is expected to manage the business.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_431.wav|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_432.wav|In fact, the reasons are simple.|43,,,
wav48/p270/p270_433.wav|We know about the crisis in cattle.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_434.wav|The British government does not want to know.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_435.wav|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_436.wav|I didn't get to keep it.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_437.wav|Their condition is described as satisfactory.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_438.wav|It would be very dangerous.|43,,,,

wav48/p270/p270_440.wav|The villagers were shot in the head at short range.|43,,,,

wav48/p270/p270_443.wav|They are interior designers and architects.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_444.wav|It shows the right amount of progress.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_445.wav|I think the goalkeeper should have gone.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_446.wav|They had learned from the lessons of the first game.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_447.wav|It was to be inclusive.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_448.wav|No further details of expansion plans were given.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_449.wav|The budget was too low for that.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_450.wav|Our legal advice is clear.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_451.wav|Striking the deal has come as a big relief.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_452.wav|A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.|43,,,,
wav48/p270/p270_453.wav|They were good years for him.|43,,,,

wav48/p270/p270_462.wav|Something happened on that island.|43,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_001.wav|Please call Stella. |44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |44,,
wav48/p271/p271_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |44,,
wav48/p271/p271_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |44,,
wav48/p271/p271_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |44,,
wav48/p271/p271_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|44,,
wav48/p271/p271_025.wav|She looked so young.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_026.wav|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_027.wav|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_028.wav|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_029.wav|They have no history.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_030.wav|However, the following year the cancer returned.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_031.wav|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|44,,
wav48/p271/p271_032.wav|I'd just like to play.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_033.wav|This is the window.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_034.wav|I feel I did not have enough time.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_035.wav|We speak about the performance.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_036.wav|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_037.wav|It was clear.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_038.wav|Indeed, he does.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_039.wav|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_040.wav|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_041.wav|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_042.wav|We will push.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_043.wav|I hate the word.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_044.wav|They said she was stable.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_045.wav|Among them are many criminals.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_046.wav|Is a drug dealer?|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_047.wav|There is no reason at all.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_048.wav|He is too weak to move.|44,,,,

wav48/p271/p271_052.wav|Here's a clue.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_053.wav|Her body was found about four miles from the car.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_054.wav|I guess I was lucky, though.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_055.wav|I was inspired by two things.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_056.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.|44,,
wav48/p271/p271_057.wav|I love the Dome.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_058.wav|It's so awful.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_059.wav|It is unique.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_060.wav|I expect a rapid response.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_061.wav|That's the truth.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_062.wav|Jobs could go.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_063.wav|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_064.wav|Scotland had great assets.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_065.wav|It's that kind of place.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_066.wav|They are real.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_067.wav|It's good news and long overdue.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_068.wav|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_069.wav|We should have known.|44,,,,

wav48/p271/p271_074.wav|It's all I can do.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_075.wav|There could be a way back.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_076.wav|Then followed a bout of flu.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_077.wav|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.|44,,
wav48/p271/p271_078.wav|Neither it is.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_079.wav|Is there a new way forward?|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_080.wav|The party is up for it.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_081.wav|Even the one she loved.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_082.wav|He is in the queue.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_083.wav|He is driven.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_084.wav|A play is a set of actions.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_085.wav|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_086.wav|Someone who cares|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_087.wav|By then, he was walking on water.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_088.wav|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_089.wav|They lived for their children.|44,,,,

wav48/p271/p271_096.wav|This one did.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_097.wav|Then came the crunch.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_098.wav|It is annoying.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_099.wav|It is home-grown.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_100.wav|They are now divorced.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_101.wav|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_102.wav|I saw the whole thing.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_103.wav|However, we have not come to any conclusions.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_104.wav|I'm not looking for a breakthrough.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_105.wav|It is a love affair.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_106.wav|They make a selective perception process.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_107.wav|That would be unlawful.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_108.wav|We have an election in eight days.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_109.wav|He takes the job.|44,,,,

wav48/p271/p271_118.wav|It is so sad.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_119.wav|You had better believe it.|44,,,,

wav48/p271/p271_121.wav|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_122.wav|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.|44,,,,

wav48/p271/p271_131.wav|What will happen then?|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_132.wav|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_133.wav|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_134.wav|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_135.wav|It was very frightened and dirty.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_136.wav|Is that it?|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_137.wav|My daughter is an adult.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_138.wav|He should resign.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_139.wav|I was dead.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_140.wav|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_141.wav|It seems so long since I did the exams.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_142.wav|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.|44,,,

wav48/p271/p271_149.wav|Note the date.|44,,,,

wav48/p271/p271_163.wav|I'd love to be like Peter.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_164.wav|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_165.wav|It has to be now.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_166.wav|I haven't had a lesson in four years.|44,,,,

wav48/p271/p271_174.wav|By then, however, both men were already in the US.|44,,
wav48/p271/p271_175.wav|You had to go and see him.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_176.wav|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_177.wav|It is really good news.|44,,,,

wav48/p271/p271_197.wav|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_198.wav|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_199.wav|It is a farce.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_200.wav|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.|44,,
wav48/p271/p271_201.wav|I came home by ambulance.|44,,,,

wav48/p271/p271_208.wav|He had suffered a heart attack.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_209.wav|It was worth a photograph.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_210.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_211.wav|I don't want to use it.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_212.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.|44,,,,

wav48/p271/p271_214.wav|It had all been arranged.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_215.wav|I had decided to quit the show.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_216.wav|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.|44,,,,

wav48/p271/p271_219.wav|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_220.wav|That idea is rubbish.|44,,,,

wav48/p271/p271_242.wav|It's quite nice.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_243.wav|Three weeks later, he resigned.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_244.wav|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_245.wav|It would still have been a good film, but very different.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_246.wav|Of further privacy, he had no need.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_247.wav|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_248.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_249.wav|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_250.wav|It is hard won.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_251.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_252.wav|You can feel at home in China.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_253.wav|The scene is about this?|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_254.wav|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_255.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_256.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.|44,,
wav48/p271/p271_257.wav|The concerns are the same.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_258.wav|That could be in place by next year.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_259.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_260.wav|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_261.wav|Chelsea was a great club.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_262.wav|Is that a serious question?|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_263.wav|This is the first step.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_264.wav|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_265.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_266.wav|Blood samples were taken.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_267.wav|We shall rely on human beings.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_268.wav|This is a question of Islam.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_269.wav|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_270.wav|You take a risk.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_271.wav|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_272.wav|He was also married with two children.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_273.wav|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_274.wav|The prison has been affected by unrest in the past.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_275.wav|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.|44,,
wav48/p271/p271_276.wav|That goes back a long way.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_277.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_278.wav|She failed in her action.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_279.wav|They seem to get away with it.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_280.wav|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_281.wav|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_282.wav|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_283.wav|We are a grandmother.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_284.wav|He looked very sharp.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_285.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_286.wav|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_287.wav|You feel very helpless.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_288.wav|You've got to have both sides.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_289.wav|They have shown a great desire and attitude.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_290.wav|It was a virus.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_291.wav|She is an expert on medical ethics.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_292.wav|It's a record label, not a form of music.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_293.wav|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_294.wav|This is a national crisis.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_295.wav|We are not going to forget.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_296.wav|No Briton has ever won.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_297.wav|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_298.wav|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_299.wav|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_300.wav|Nothing is safe.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_301.wav|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_302.wav|There is no openness.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_303.wav|They are wrong.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_304.wav|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_305.wav|This is a war over our home.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_306.wav|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_307.wav|The court had a number of empty seats.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_308.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_309.wav|The plot is minimal.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_310.wav|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_311.wav|There is no excuse.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_312.wav|The letters are going out today.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_313.wav|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_314.wav|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_315.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_316.wav|My whole life has changed.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_317.wav|We are a peaceful people.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_318.wav|The election is total confusion and chaos.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_319.wav|Henman has been warned.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_320.wav|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_321.wav|For the moment, our position remains the same.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_322.wav|They had a confession.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_323.wav|We are in the end game.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_324.wav|It will work.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_325.wav|It's too horrible to think.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_326.wav|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_327.wav|There was no time scale.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_328.wav|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_329.wav|It is a job creation scheme.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_330.wav|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_331.wav|Relief was beyond belief.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_332.wav|Is that an issue?|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_333.wav|They should take their mobile phones.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_334.wav|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_335.wav|The same things will happen with GM foods.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_336.wav|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_337.wav|Who will do it?|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_338.wav|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_339.wav|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.|44,,
wav48/p271/p271_340.wav|I've got no secret.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_341.wav|This is a big advantage.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_342.wav|went on sale.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_343.wav|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.|44,,
wav48/p271/p271_344.wav|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_345.wav|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_346.wav|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_347.wav|I got a yellow card.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_348.wav|We have big ideas.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_349.wav|I believe the gap is nearly there.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_350.wav|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_351.wav|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_352.wav|Until they came to do it.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_353.wav|It is not like us.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_354.wav|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_355.wav|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_356.wav|We will be homeless.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_357.wav|That would help.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_358.wav|My husband was angry.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_359.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_360.wav|It is a memorial.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_361.wav|And he laughs.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_362.wav|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_363.wav|There was a substantial explosion.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_364.wav|It's not pretty, but it's effective.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_365.wav|Their time has gone.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_366.wav|It has only been rumours.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_367.wav|All the investment is possible through the public sector.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_368.wav|The death rates are still as high.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_369.wav|Now, though, he has an incentive.|44,,
wav48/p271/p271_370.wav|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_371.wav|It seems a long time ago.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_372.wav|There is no signature.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_373.wav|Washington is consumed by the crisis.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_374.wav|It became a national network.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_375.wav|I am a wealthy person.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_376.wav|The BBC was a disgrace.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_377.wav|The Cabinet is split over the issue.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_378.wav|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_379.wav|It has been a lovely family occasion.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_380.wav|That's the name of the game, though.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_381.wav|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_382.wav|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_383.wav|Yet the data is compelling.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_384.wav|It's a real problem.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_385.wav|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_386.wav|Who will provide the wine?|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_387.wav|It is unusual.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_388.wav|They deserved the win.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_389.wav|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_390.wav|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.|44,,
wav48/p271/p271_391.wav|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_392.wav|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_393.wav|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_394.wav|But we are a young side.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_395.wav|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_396.wav|It will take place in July.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_397.wav|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_398.wav|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_399.wav|But, in fact, the reverse is true.|44,,
wav48/p271/p271_400.wav|It is full-scale.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_401.wav|I never won a penny throughout my career.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_402.wav|He will be judged by his actions.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_403.wav|It is an absolute nonsense.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_404.wav|They are not left wing.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_405.wav|They recorded their debut album in New York.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_406.wav|In a way he was.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_407.wav|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_408.wav|It might be.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_409.wav|The weekly average was three hours.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_410.wav|He scored a touchdown.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_411.wav|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_412.wav|He got his degree.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_413.wav|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_414.wav|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_415.wav|But we finished the show.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_416.wav|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_417.wav|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_418.wav|That may be.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_419.wav|It is legally binding.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_420.wav|Is there any prospect of this happening?|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_421.wav|The service from the other players was super.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_422.wav|I've invented a village in East Lothian.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_423.wav|Paris is not only young.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_424.wav|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_425.wav|He is to appeal.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_426.wav|It was like someone had died.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_427.wav|I'm very grateful.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_428.wav|The weather in the area of the crash was severe.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_429.wav|We have the location, which is assured.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_430.wav|There is no suggestion of any sinister intent on his behalf.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_431.wav|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_432.wav|I know the worry over Iraq.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_433.wav|Everything has collapsed.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_434.wav|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_435.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_436.wav|The document argues that culture is at the heart of Scottish society.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_437.wav|We are all equal.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_438.wav|Admission is free.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_439.wav|We are now up against it.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_440.wav|In it went.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_441.wav|We were used.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_442.wav|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.|44,,
wav48/p271/p271_443.wav|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_444.wav|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.|44,,,
wav48/p271/p271_445.wav|They were not even allowed to see them.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_446.wav|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_447.wav|Bill is a mentor.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_448.wav|We are certainly moving in the right direction as a club.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_449.wav|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_450.wav|Was it worth it?|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_451.wav|It was ignored.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_452.wav|It is bizarre.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_453.wav|It had been in place since last July.|44,,,,
wav48/p271/p271_454.wav|It's a miracle.|44,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |45,,
wav48/p272/p272_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |45,,
wav48/p272/p272_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |45,,
wav48/p272/p272_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |45,,
wav48/p272/p272_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|45,,
wav48/p272/p272_025.wav|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.|45,,,,

wav48/p272/p272_035.wav|Then, suddenly, they weren't.|45,,
wav48/p272/p272_036.wav|Was it worth it?|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_037.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.|45,,,,

wav48/p272/p272_044.wav|I did not see any reason to change the captain.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_045.wav|He's just in it for himself.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_046.wav|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_047.wav|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_048.wav|We will push.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_049.wav|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.|45,,
wav48/p272/p272_050.wav|This represents a tough game for us.|45,,,,

wav48/p272/p272_062.wav|There was no safety net.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_063.wav|It is unique.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_064.wav|That's the truth.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_065.wav|They are ready.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_066.wav|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.|45,,,,

wav48/p272/p272_080.wav|He was at home with his pals.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_081.wav|It was magic.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_082.wav|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.|45,,,,

wav48/p272/p272_086.wav|Today she has been released.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_087.wav|He is in the queue.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_088.wav|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_089.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_090.wav|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_091.wav|Someone who cares|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_092.wav|By then, he was walking on water.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_093.wav|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_094.wav|It is a blow.|45,,,,

wav48/p272/p272_100.wav|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_101.wav|It was clear.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_102.wav|It is annoying.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_103.wav|But I was wrong.|45,,,,

wav48/p272/p272_112.wav|Two of the team became ill.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_113.wav|He takes the job.|45,,,,

wav48/p272/p272_118.wav|I was fighting for my life, I thought.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_119.wav|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_120.wav|It is so sad.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_121.wav|The mood is upbeat.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_122.wav|It is rubbish.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_123.wav|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_124.wav|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.|45,,
wav48/p272/p272_125.wav|Who would have?|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_126.wav|There were no grounds for his action.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_127.wav|I can't even get into the A team.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_128.wav|I'm so angry.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_129.wav|She really suffered for her art.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_130.wav|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_131.wav|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_132.wav|No production was achieved.|45,,,,

wav48/p272/p272_134.wav|This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_135.wav|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.|45,,
wav48/p272/p272_136.wav|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_137.wav|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.|45,,,,

wav48/p272/p272_139.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_140.wav|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_141.wav|I had decided to quit the show.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_142.wav|We want to keep the pound.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_143.wav|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_144.wav|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_145.wav|Who would be right?|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_146.wav|She died at her home.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_147.wav|He realises his mistake.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_148.wav|The role of the law lords would be retained.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_149.wav|It is not just about pay.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_150.wav|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_151.wav|So I got a blood test.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_152.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_153.wav|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_154.wav|I was so nervous.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_155.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.|45,,
wav48/p272/p272_156.wav|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_157.wav|We also enjoyed a lot of support.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_158.wav|We are on a four-year mission.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_159.wav|They should come clean.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_160.wav|My Dad is a hero.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_161.wav|He can do no wrong.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_162.wav|Well, he should know.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_163.wav|It is so unfair.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_164.wav|I will tell you.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_165.wav|I've put my own money into this project.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_166.wav|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_167.wav|It is not like us.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_168.wav|We've all had the shots.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_169.wav|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.|45,,
wav48/p272/p272_170.wav|Again, we were lucky.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_171.wav|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_172.wav|Does that put pressure on us?|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_173.wav|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_174.wav|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_175.wav|As we worked.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_176.wav|Tony had arrived.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_177.wav|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_178.wav|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.|45,,
wav48/p272/p272_179.wav|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_180.wav|They need to look after themselves.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_181.wav|I saw military vehicles in the distance.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_182.wav|What has caused the demise of singing?|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_183.wav|Our team is just so young.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_184.wav|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_185.wav|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_186.wav|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_187.wav|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_188.wav|Peace was won.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_189.wav|It's a fact.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_190.wav|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_191.wav|We believe a third party was involved.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_192.wav|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_193.wav|Tommy is not a problem.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_194.wav|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_195.wav|But she might be.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_196.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.|45,,
wav48/p272/p272_197.wav|It was worth a photograph.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_198.wav|They make a selective perception process.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_199.wav|We have an election in eight days.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_200.wav|Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_201.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_202.wav|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_203.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_204.wav|A Grampian Police spokesman said.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_205.wav|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_206.wav|In each case they were a goal down.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_207.wav|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_208.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_209.wav|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_210.wav|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_211.wav|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_212.wav|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_213.wav|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_214.wav|You should always be able to get out in some direction.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_215.wav|It's not before time.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_216.wav|The report is due out next month.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_217.wav|But she was.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_218.wav|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.|45,,
wav48/p272/p272_219.wav|At the time, he was a living legend.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_220.wav|They must do it.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_221.wav|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_222.wav|However, no further action was taken by police.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_223.wav|Until they came to do it.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_224.wav|Half of young people had had contact with the police.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_225.wav|Well, they were the unlucky ones.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_226.wav|There is no excuse.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_227.wav|Three weeks later, he resigned.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_228.wav|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_229.wav|But it's a subtle process.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_230.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_231.wav|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_232.wav|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_233.wav|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_234.wav|It is hard won.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_235.wav|Our policy is clear.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_236.wav|The scene is about this?|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_237.wav|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_238.wav|There wasn't a goal.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_239.wav|I should think so, too.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_240.wav|There's the mix.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_241.wav|The concerns are the same.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_242.wav|I can't get a job.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_243.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_244.wav|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_245.wav|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_246.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_247.wav|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.|45,,
wav48/p272/p272_248.wav|Is that a serious question?|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_249.wav|This is the first step.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_250.wav|They must play for each other.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_251.wav|Souter will be back.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_252.wav|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.|45,,
wav48/p272/p272_253.wav|Blood samples were taken.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_254.wav|They want to shut the Scottish Office.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_255.wav|We shall rely on human beings.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_256.wav|This is a question of Islam.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_257.wav|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_258.wav|Immediate action must be taken.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_259.wav|It's very nice.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_260.wav|He was also married with two children.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_261.wav|The system can work.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_262.wav|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_263.wav|We're in shock.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_264.wav|Our objective is to tackle poverty.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_265.wav|It's a way of life.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_266.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_267.wav|It was very fast.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_268.wav|The record companies have gone through the floor.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_269.wav|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_270.wav|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_271.wav|If not, he should go home.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_272.wav|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_273.wav|He looked very sharp.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_274.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_275.wav|All options are open.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_276.wav|Dialogue is the key.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_277.wav|They have shown a great desire and attitude.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_278.wav|It was a virus.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_279.wav|Maloney is an engaging talent.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_280.wav|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_281.wav|This is a national crisis.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_282.wav|It was good.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_283.wav|Who did the recruiting?|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_284.wav|Bombing slaughter rejected|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_285.wav|The songs are just so good.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_286.wav|The goals will come.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_287.wav|There's a pause.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_288.wav|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_289.wav|I was the sheep.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_290.wav|What has altered?|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_291.wav|I was brought up in a mining background.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_292.wav|Nothing is safe.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_293.wav|It would still have been a good film, but very different.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_294.wav|One was a lawyer.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_295.wav|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_296.wav|They are wrong.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_297.wav|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_298.wav|The plot is minimal.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_299.wav|You are the glory.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_300.wav|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.|45,,
wav48/p272/p272_301.wav|The letters are going out today.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_302.wav|We want to play at the worlds.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_303.wav|He is also keen to win the European order of merit.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_304.wav|My whole life has changed.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_305.wav|We are a peaceful people.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_306.wav|You may have a short memory.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_307.wav|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_308.wav|My body is clearly capable.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_309.wav|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_310.wav|It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_311.wav|A review is under way.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_312.wav|It will work.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_313.wav|I came into this world with nothing.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_314.wav|It's too horrible to think.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_315.wav|We think all other measures are not exhausted.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_316.wav|Off with their heads.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_317.wav|Is there a new way forward?|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_318.wav|I was invited to work in Germany.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_319.wav|Is that an issue?|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_320.wav|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_321.wav|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_322.wav|The same things will happen with GM foods.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_323.wav|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_324.wav|It sounded as if it might well be tragic.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_325.wav|Well, it won't.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_326.wav|These days are long gone.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_327.wav|Two people were interviewed.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_328.wav|I've got no secret.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_329.wav|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_330.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_331.wav|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_332.wav|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.|45,,
wav48/p272/p272_333.wav|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_334.wav|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_335.wav|He loves the big occasions.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_336.wav|The performance was excellent.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_337.wav|That has been lost.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_338.wav|Tell us about it.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_339.wav|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_340.wav|She said they would appeal.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_341.wav|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_342.wav|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_343.wav|Both of those promises have already been honoured.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_344.wav|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_345.wav|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_346.wav|As, indeed, they would be.|45,,
wav48/p272/p272_347.wav|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_348.wav|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_349.wav|We will be homeless.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_350.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_351.wav|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_352.wav|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_353.wav|There was a substantial explosion.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_354.wav|Not so, it seems.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_355.wav|He could make it.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_356.wav|Four policemen were wounded.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_357.wav|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_358.wav|It's now down in black and white.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_359.wav|Now, though, he has an incentive.|45,,
wav48/p272/p272_360.wav|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_361.wav|They have not done so this season so far.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_362.wav|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_363.wav|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_364.wav|So there, we won.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_365.wav|By that time, however, it was already too late.|45,,
wav48/p272/p272_366.wav|There is no signature.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_367.wav|It was a funny game.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_368.wav|He was the architect.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_369.wav|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_370.wav|I've never seen a game like it.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_371.wav|I am a wealthy person.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_372.wav|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_373.wav|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.|45,,
wav48/p272/p272_374.wav|The Cabinet is split over the issue.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_375.wav|Something is wrong.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_376.wav|You can cope with it.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_377.wav|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_378.wav|That's the name of the game, though.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_379.wav|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_380.wav|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_381.wav|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_382.wav|At the last I found a bunker.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_383.wav|Yet the data is compelling.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_384.wav|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_385.wav|It's a real problem.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_386.wav|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_387.wav|I was in the train station overnight.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_388.wav|It is unusual.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_389.wav|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_390.wav|It's like a basketball.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_391.wav|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.|45,,
wav48/p272/p272_392.wav|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_393.wav|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_394.wav|It was a kind of contempt.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_395.wav|It was a breathtaking moment.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_396.wav|The car was just there.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_397.wav|It will take place in July.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_398.wav|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_399.wav|Is that possible?|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_400.wav|But, in fact, the reverse is true.|45,,
wav48/p272/p272_401.wav|What was the difference between them?|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_402.wav|Emotions were complex.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_403.wav|Then , he laughs.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_404.wav|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_405.wav|It is an absolute nonsense.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_406.wav|They recorded their debut album in New York.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_407.wav|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_408.wav|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_409.wav|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_410.wav|Feel the air, the space.|45,,,
wav48/p272/p272_411.wav|He got his degree.|45,,,,
wav48/p272/p272_412.wav|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.|45,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |46,,
wav48/p273/p273_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |46,,,
wav48/p273/p273_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |46,,,
wav48/p273/p273_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, and its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |46,,
wav48/p273/p273_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |46,,
wav48/p273/p273_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |46,,,
wav48/p273/p273_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |46,,,
wav48/p273/p273_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |46,,,
wav48/p273/p273_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |46,,,
wav48/p273/p273_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |46,,
wav48/p273/p273_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|46,,
wav48/p273/p273_025.wav|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_026.wav|It was as if I had been stabbed.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_027.wav|Because we do not need it.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_028.wav|It is about control of our economy.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_029.wav|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.|46,,,
wav48/p273/p273_030.wav|It is a tough game but we have a chance.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_031.wav|I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_032.wav|It carries a double message.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_033.wav|That is the face of fear.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_034.wav|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_035.wav|Among them are many criminals.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_036.wav|This will save interest charges.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_037.wav|Every aspect of our play was first class.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_038.wav|He looks like an Afghan.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_039.wav|Everything else is a bonus.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_040.wav|People want to see me on the screen.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_041.wav|Her body was found about four miles from the car.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_042.wav|I was inspired by two things.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_043.wav|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_044.wav|My fitness was very poor.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_045.wav|We have to look beyond the very short term.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_046.wav|The drivers had an awful lot of verbal abuse.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_047.wav|I expect a rapid response.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_048.wav|I must take a seat.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_049.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_050.wav|How are you, sir ?|46,,,
wav48/p273/p273_051.wav|So is that it, then ?|46,,,
wav48/p273/p273_052.wav|Do I have a favourite ?|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_053.wav|What do we do ?|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_054.wav|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.|46,,,
wav48/p273/p273_055.wav|Let's hope that it does.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_056.wav|We have to keep our clients.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_057.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.|46,,,
wav48/p273/p273_058.wav|We will pay their bills.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_059.wav|It was exactly four months away.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_060.wav|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_061.wav|I was conceived in Aberdeen.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_062.wav|Robin Williams is very subdued.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_063.wav|The spirit in the dressing room is tremendous.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_064.wav|I was as strong as a horse.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_065.wav|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_066.wav|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_067.wav|Both sides have been hit by injury.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_068.wav|The creditors have lost a lot.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_069.wav|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_070.wav|Even the one she loved.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_071.wav|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_072.wav|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_073.wav|It makes for an interesting conference.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_074.wav|This view was echoed by another Scottish analyst.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_075.wav|No progress has been made.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_076.wav|He has been a success this year.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_077.wav|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_078.wav|We have to offer value for money.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_079.wav|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_080.wav|It's so hard to shift.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_081.wav|They lived for their children.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_082.wav|Potions said he would drive.|46,,,,

wav48/p273/p273_095.wav|We intend to change the model.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_096.wav|We should recognise that others have done a good job.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_097.wav|But the battle has only just begun.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_098.wav|The following are the principal provisions.|46,,,,

wav48/p273/p273_116.wav|This is a frightening development.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_117.wav|Which can happen any time.|46,,,,

wav48/p273/p273_160.wav|Phase one was a shambles.|46,,,,
wav48/p273/p273_161.wav|I did not have a bet on myself.|46,,,,

wav48/p274/p274_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. )|47,,,
wav48/p274/p274_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. )|47,,,,
wav48/p274/p274_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. )|47,,
wav48/p274/p274_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. )|47,,
wav48/p274/p274_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. )|47,,,
wav48/p274/p274_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. )|47,,,
wav48/p274/p274_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbows in various ways. )|47,,,,
wav48/p274/p274_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. )|47,,,,
wav48/p274/p274_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. )|47,,,,
wav48/p274/p274_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. )|47,,,,

wav48/p274/p274_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. )|47,,,,
wav48/p274/p274_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. )|47,,,,
wav48/p274/p274_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. )|47,,,
wav48/p274/p274_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. )|47,,,,
wav48/p274/p274_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. )|47,,,
wav48/p274/p274_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. )|47,,,,
wav48/p274/p274_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. )|47,,
wav48/p274/p274_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.)|47,,

wav48/p274/p274_450.wav|We just thought it would be kept under the carpet.)|47,,,,
wav48/p274/p274_451.wav|It could cause a little bit of disruption.)|47,,,,

wav48/p274/p274_453.wav|I think the goalkeeper should have gone.)|47,,,,

wav48/p274/p274_461.wav|The boys are mentally focused.)|47,,,,
wav48/p274/p274_462.wav|Driving has been the key.)|47,,,,
wav48/p274/p274_463.wav|It's because they can't understand the language.)|47,,,,
wav48/p274/p274_464.wav|Then came the farewell to Europe.)|47,,,,
wav48/p274/p274_465.wav|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.)|47,,,,
wav48/p274/p274_466.wav|Phil Mickelson did that last year.)|47,,,,
wav48/p274/p274_467.wav|The answer was up there on the stage.)|47,,,,

wav48/p274/p274_469.wav|He will not be involved in school discipline.)|47,,,,
wav48/p274/p274_470.wav|You have to have a proven track record to get them.)|47,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_001.wav|Please call Stella. |48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |48,,
wav48/p275/p275_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |48,,
wav48/p275/p275_009.wav|There is , according to the legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |48,,
wav48/p275/p275_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbows in various ways. |48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |48,,
wav48/p275/p275_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|48,,
wav48/p275/p275_025.wav|But it failed.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_026.wav|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_027.wav|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_028.wav|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_029.wav|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|48,,
wav48/p275/p275_030.wav|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_031.wav|There's a story, too.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_032.wav|He was jailed for four years.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_033.wav|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_034.wav|Then, suddenly, they weren't.|48,,
wav48/p275/p275_035.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_036.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_037.wav|They're just different.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_038.wav|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.|48,,
wav48/p275/p275_039.wav|Indeed, he does.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_040.wav|Sadly, it can't.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_041.wav|Dancing was her life.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_042.wav|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_043.wav|We will push.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_044.wav|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_045.wav|This represents a tough game for us.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_046.wav|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_047.wav|Among them are many criminals.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_048.wav|Every aspect of our play was first class.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_049.wav|He looks like an Afghan.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_050.wav|Here's a clue.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_051.wav|I had come back from London.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_052.wav|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_053.wav|It is unique.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_054.wav|That's the truth.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_055.wav|There's a danger.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_056.wav|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_057.wav|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_058.wav|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_059.wav|This is the first step.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_060.wav|It's good news and long overdue.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_061.wav|And if he hadn't become a musician?|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_062.wav|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_063.wav|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_064.wav|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.|48,,,,

wav48/p275/p275_088.wav|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_089.wav|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.|48,,,,

wav48/p275/p275_135.wav|What will happen then?|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_136.wav|It's not true.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_137.wav|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_138.wav|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_139.wav|It was very frightened and dirty.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_140.wav|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_141.wav|Is that it?|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_142.wav|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_143.wav|It seems so long since I did the exams.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_144.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_145.wav|Who would be right?|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_146.wav|No-one in Downing Street can speak the language of the unions.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_147.wav|He realises his mistake.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_148.wav|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.|48,,
wav48/p275/p275_149.wav|I was awful.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_150.wav|We have the location, which is assured.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_151.wav|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_152.wav|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_153.wav|I am just trying to do my job.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_154.wav|So I got a blood test.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_155.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_156.wav|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_157.wav|The weather forecast isn't good.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_158.wav|It's amazing, but I have never seen a drug test in Scotland.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_159.wav|They have not been named.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_160.wav|We also enjoyed a lot of support.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_161.wav|It was by the numbers.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_162.wav|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_163.wav|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_164.wav|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.|48,,
wav48/p275/p275_165.wav|Well, he should know.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_166.wav|Was this element always there?|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_167.wav|These days are long gone.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_168.wav|I was in the train station overnight.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_169.wav|We've all had the shots.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_170.wav|Tell it like it was?|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_171.wav|Seven people were later detained by police.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_172.wav|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_173.wav|You had to go and see him.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_174.wav|In a way he was.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_175.wav|One season, they might do well.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_176.wav|Is Saddam a threat?|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_177.wav|As we worked.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_178.wav|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_179.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_180.wav|He deserved the win.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_181.wav|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_182.wav|Tony had arrived.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_183.wav|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_184.wav|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_185.wav|His name was unknown.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_186.wav|It's an idea.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_187.wav|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.|48,,
wav48/p275/p275_188.wav|Four policemen were wounded.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_189.wav|I saw military vehicles in the distance.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_190.wav|What has caused the demise of singing?|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_191.wav|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_192.wav|It is a farce.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_193.wav|Peace was won.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_194.wav|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.|48,,
wav48/p275/p275_195.wav|Yet the data is compelling.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_196.wav|I came home by ambulance.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_197.wav|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_198.wav|I have a cold.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_199.wav|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_200.wav|Tommy is not a problem.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_201.wav|Who will pay for this?|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_203.wav|But she might be.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_205.wav|Some realism was needed about the time, resources and management.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_207.wav|I don't want to use it.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_208.wav|Feel the heat?|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_209.wav|He knows a lot.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_210.wav|You have a plan?|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_211.wav|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.|48,,
wav48/p275/p275_212.wav|It had all been arranged.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_213.wav|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_214.wav|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_215.wav|He seemed to lose his focus.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_216.wav|Work has started.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_217.wav|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_218.wav|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_219.wav|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_220.wav|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_221.wav|During the communist time they were very privileged.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_222.wav|We could easily be cut again.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_223.wav|Saturday is gone.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_224.wav|It's the Tate.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_225.wav|Clearly, the stakes are high.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_226.wav|I will win.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_227.wav|The report is due out next month.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_228.wav|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_229.wav|He is in the queue.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_230.wav|My wife and family are the support system.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_231.wav|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_233.wav|The parties have been given until today to respond.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_234.wav|Of course I was tempted.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_235.wav|We will treat it like a World Cup match.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_236.wav|It would still have been a good film, but very different.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_237.wav|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_238.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_239.wav|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_240.wav|It is hard won.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_241.wav|Our policy is clear.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_242.wav|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_243.wav|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_244.wav|I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_246.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.|48,,
wav48/p275/p275_247.wav|It was a hit.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_248.wav|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_249.wav|I can't get a job.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_250.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_251.wav|Kirkwood was arrested.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_252.wav|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.|48,,
wav48/p275/p275_253.wav|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_254.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_255.wav|Is that a serious question?|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_256.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_257.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_258.wav|Souter will be back.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_259.wav|Blood samples were taken.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_260.wav|They want to shut the Scottish Office.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_261.wav|It will be done in stages.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_262.wav|This is a question of Islam.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_263.wav|That review will look at the management across the sector as a whole.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_264.wav|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_265.wav|It's very nice.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_266.wav|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_268.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_269.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_270.wav|It was very fast.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_271.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_272.wav|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_273.wav|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_274.wav|It's so awful.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_275.wav|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_276.wav|We are a grandmother.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_277.wav|He looked very sharp.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_278.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_279.wav|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_280.wav|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.|48,,
wav48/p275/p275_281.wav|You've got to have both sides.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_282.wav|It was a virus.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_283.wav|Yet, it worked.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_284.wav|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_285.wav|It was good.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_286.wav|Who did the recruiting?|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_287.wav|Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_288.wav|Bombing slaughter rejected|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_289.wav|We are not going to forget.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_290.wav|I could never be cool.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_291.wav|Who can predict?|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_292.wav|There was a vacuum.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_293.wav|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_294.wav|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_295.wav|The tournament has now been cancelled.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_296.wav|She is really magic.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_297.wav|One was a lawyer.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_298.wav|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_299.wav|There were no passengers on board.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_300.wav|It could work.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_301.wav|This is a war over our home.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_302.wav|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_303.wav|The court had a number of empty seats.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_304.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_305.wav|The plot is minimal.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_306.wav|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_307.wav|There's no evidence he was ever there.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_308.wav|You should be.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_309.wav|The minister is the engineer.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_310.wav|The letters are going out today.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_311.wav|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_312.wav|We have got no money to go anywhere.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_313.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_314.wav|We have got to get the points from this one.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_315.wav|My whole life has changed.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_316.wav|The election is total confusion and chaos.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_317.wav|Kids are terrible.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_320.wav|We are in the end game.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_321.wav|Our message was inclusive.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_322.wav|Off with their heads.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_323.wav|The figures are bad, but not that bad.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_324.wav|My view has now completely changed.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_325.wav|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_326.wav|Is that an issue?|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_327.wav|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_328.wav|Finally, he paid for the movie.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_329.wav|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_330.wav|It's been hard.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_331.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_332.wav|Who will do it?|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_333.wav|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_334.wav|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_335.wav|He also insisted that no concession had been made to the French.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_336.wav|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_337.wav|We are the gateway to justice.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_338.wav|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_339.wav|Yet, for the money, he was not the man of the match.|48,,
wav48/p275/p275_340.wav|This is a friendly match?|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_341.wav|I got a yellow card.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_342.wav|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_343.wav|Tell us about it.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_344.wav|There may be reasons for it.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_345.wav|I believe the gap is nearly there.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_346.wav|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_347.wav|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_348.wav|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_349.wav|She is free.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_350.wav|Both of those promises have already been honoured.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_351.wav|Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_352.wav|The pair are very much in love.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_353.wav|It is not like us.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_354.wav|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_355.wav|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_356.wav|We will be homeless.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_357.wav|That would help.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_358.wav|It is a memorial.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_359.wav|This is a club on the rise.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_360.wav|All the investment is possible through the public sector.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_361.wav|I was conceived in Aberdeen.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_362.wav|The death rates are still as high.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_363.wav|He's been in a nursing home for two years.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_364.wav|It's now down in black and white.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_365.wav|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_366.wav|They have not done so this season so far.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_367.wav|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_368.wav|There is no signature.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_369.wav|I am a wealthy person.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_370.wav|Colour was at the core of his life.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_371.wav|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.|48,,
wav48/p275/p275_372.wav|It is hard to understand.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_373.wav|Something is wrong.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_374.wav|You can cope with it.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_375.wav|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_376.wav|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_377.wav|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_378.wav|It is the old story.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_379.wav|It looked like a river.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_380.wav|It's a real problem.|48,,,,

wav48/p275/p275_388.wav|I'm glad I came.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_389.wav|But we are a young side.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_390.wav|That set the tone.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_391.wav|It was a breathtaking moment.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_392.wav|What happened in the summer?|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_393.wav|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_394.wav|There were no immediate reports of injuries.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_395.wav|The prison has been affected by unrest in the past.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_396.wav|What was the difference between them?|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_397.wav|He will be judged by his actions.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_398.wav|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_399.wav|It is an absolute nonsense.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_400.wav|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.|48,,,
wav48/p275/p275_402.wav|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_403.wav|It might be.|48,,,,

wav48/p275/p275_410.wav|We went straight into the bedroom.|48,,,,
wav48/p275/p275_411.wav|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.|48,,,

wav48/p275/p275_429.wav|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.|48,,,

wav48/p276/p276_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |49,,
wav48/p276/p276_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |49,,,,

wav48/p276/p276_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |49,,,
wav48/p276/p276_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |49,,
wav48/p276/p276_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |49,,
wav48/p276/p276_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |49,,,
wav48/p276/p276_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |49,,,
wav48/p276/p276_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |49,,,
wav48/p276/p276_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |49,,,
wav48/p276/p276_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |49,,
wav48/p276/p276_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|49,,

wav48/p276/p276_029.wav|What do we do ?|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_030.wav|They might have asked, for goodness sake.|49,,,
wav48/p276/p276_031.wav|Smoking is also very important.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_032.wav|We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.|49,,,,

wav48/p276/p276_040.wav|I can feel the sound inside.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_041.wav|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.|49,,,
wav48/p276/p276_042.wav|He is married with three children.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_043.wav|I might well have done so already.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_044.wav|This is slightly negative for inflation.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_045.wav|And they had a case.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_046.wav|We believe a third party was involved.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_047.wav|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_048.wav|It carried a double message.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_049.wav|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_050.wav|But not a penny has been paid.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_051.wav|Perhaps it is eyeing a mortgage bank.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_052.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.|49,,,,

wav48/p276/p276_056.wav|They have shown a great desire and attitude.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_057.wav|Among them are many criminals.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_058.wav|And they removed a Borderer.|49,,,,

wav48/p276/p276_060.wav|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.|49,,,,

wav48/p276/p276_063.wav|We like being the underdogs.|49,,,,

wav48/p276/p276_073.wav|The Government does not go far enough.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_074.wav|He phoned the number in the brochure.|49,,,,

wav48/p276/p276_084.wav|The new deal will now be put to the officers.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_085.wav|Carlton also declined to comment last night.|49,,,,

wav48/p276/p276_094.wav|We should all be grateful.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_095.wav|He's not getting into any games.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_096.wav|The coach is a man who is very ambitious.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_097.wav|We are talking about the outskirts of London.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_098.wav|It was exactly four months away.|49,,,,

wav48/p276/p276_139.wav|I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_140.wav|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.|49,,,

wav48/p276/p276_151.wav|Was it the wife ?|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_152.wav|Why change it ?|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_153.wav|And they all have a vote.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_154.wav|But they must believe in themselves.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_155.wav|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_156.wav|Token gestures of tiny tax cuts will not do.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_157.wav|We made a world record together.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_158.wav|This is the logic of punishment assaults.|49,,,,

wav48/p276/p276_165.wav|He removed the rubble with the help of passers-by.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_166.wav|It is a good lifestyle.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_167.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.|49,,,,

wav48/p276/p276_178.wav|Advice and counselling will be offered.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_179.wav|You had better believe it.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_180.wav|It was a sobering experience.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_181.wav|I can see it now.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_182.wav|There's still plenty time left.|49,,,,

wav48/p276/p276_441.wav|It's an option, but I can't really comment.|49,,,
wav48/p276/p276_442.wav|Not many people like to do that.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_443.wav|He now lives in Fenwick in Ayrshire.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_444.wav|I might also completely change the routine.|49,,,,

wav48/p276/p276_453.wav|I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.|49,,,
wav48/p276/p276_454.wav|They must play for each other.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_455.wav|We are aiming for early March.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_456.wav|Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.|49,,,,

wav48/p276/p276_461.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_462.wav|It was very positive and very helpful.|49,,,,

wav48/p276/p276_464.wav|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.|49,,,,
wav48/p276/p276_465.wav|We are having a look.|49,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |50,,
wav48/p277/p277_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |50,,
wav48/p277/p277_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |50,,
wav48/p277/p277_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |50,,
wav48/p277/p277_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|50,,
wav48/p277/p277_025.wav|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_026.wav|Is this accurate?|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_027.wav|They have no history.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_028.wav|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|50,,
wav48/p277/p277_029.wav|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_030.wav|There's a story, too.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_031.wav|This is the window.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_032.wav|He was jailed for five years.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_033.wav|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_034.wav|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_035.wav|Then, suddenly, they weren't.|50,,
wav48/p277/p277_036.wav|Was it worth it?|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_037.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_038.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_039.wav|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_040.wav|They're just different.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_041.wav|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.|50,,
wav48/p277/p277_042.wav|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_043.wav|Indeed, he does.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_044.wav|I did not see any reason to change the captain.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_045.wav|He's just in it for himself.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_046.wav|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_047.wav|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_048.wav|We will push.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_049.wav|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.|50,,
wav48/p277/p277_050.wav|This represents a tough game for us.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_051.wav|It is bizarre.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_052.wav|They said she was stable.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_053.wav|Is a drug dealer?|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_054.wav|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_055.wav|He is too weak to move.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_056.wav|They were on holiday in Egypt.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_057.wav|He looks like an Afghan.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_058.wav|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_059.wav|Here's a clue.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_060.wav|It had been in place since last July.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_061.wav|Next league matches Celtic.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_062.wav|There was no safety net.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_063.wav|It is unique.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_064.wav|That's the truth.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_065.wav|They are ready.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_066.wav|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_067.wav|I feel I did not have enough time.|50,,,,

wav48/p277/p277_072.wav|That was a gold medal for certain.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_073.wav|He was popular.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_074.wav|But I've won both ways.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_075.wav|There was an e-mail.|50,,,,

wav48/p277/p277_077.wav|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_078.wav|Painful, but only because it's true.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_079.wav|I had my suspicions.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_080.wav|He was at home with his pals.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_081.wav|It was magic.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_082.wav|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_083.wav|It is a job creation scheme.|50,,,,

wav48/p277/p277_085.wav|Even the one she loved.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_086.wav|Today she has been released.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_087.wav|He is in the queue.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_088.wav|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_089.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_090.wav|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_091.wav|Someone who cares|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_092.wav|By then, he was walking on water.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_093.wav|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_094.wav|It is a blow.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_095.wav|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.|50,,,,

wav48/p277/p277_099.wav|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_100.wav|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_101.wav|It was clear.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_102.wav|It is annoying.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_103.wav|But I was wrong.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_104.wav|I love the Dome.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_105.wav|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_106.wav|Our position remains unchanged.|50,,,,

wav48/p277/p277_119.wav|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_120.wav|It is so sad.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_121.wav|The mood is upbeat.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_122.wav|It is rubbish.|50,,,,

wav48/p277/p277_124.wav|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.|50,,
wav48/p277/p277_125.wav|Who would have?|50,,,,

wav48/p277/p277_127.wav|I can't even get into the A team.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_128.wav|I'm so angry.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_129.wav|She really suffered for her art.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_130.wav|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_131.wav|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_132.wav|No production was achieved.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_133.wav|The BBC was a disgrace.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_134.wav|This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_135.wav|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.|50,,
wav48/p277/p277_136.wav|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_137.wav|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.|50,,,,

wav48/p277/p277_145.wav|Who would be right?|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_146.wav|She died at her home.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_147.wav|He realises his mistake.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_148.wav|The role of the law lords would be retained.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_149.wav|It is not just about pay.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_150.wav|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_151.wav|So I got a blood test.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_152.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_153.wav|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_154.wav|I was so nervous.|50,,,,

wav48/p277/p277_169.wav|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.|50,,
wav48/p277/p277_170.wav|Again, we were lucky.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_171.wav|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_172.wav|Does that put pressure on us?|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_173.wav|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.|50,,,,

wav48/p277/p277_178.wav|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.|50,,
wav48/p277/p277_179.wav|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.|50,,,

wav48/p277/p277_194.wav|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_195.wav|But she might be.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_196.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.|50,,
wav48/p277/p277_197.wav|It was worth a photograph.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_198.wav|They make a selective perception process.|50,,,,

wav48/p277/p277_206.wav|In each case they were a goal down.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_207.wav|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_208.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_209.wav|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_210.wav|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_211.wav|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_212.wav|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_213.wav|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_214.wav|You should always be able to get out in some direction.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_215.wav|It's not before time.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_216.wav|The report is due out next month.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_217.wav|But she was.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_218.wav|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.|50,,
wav48/p277/p277_219.wav|At the time, he was a living legend.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_220.wav|They must do it.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_221.wav|Dewar was certainly under attack from within his own party.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_222.wav|However, no further action was taken by police.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_223.wav|Until they came to do it.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_224.wav|Half of young people had had contact with the police.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_225.wav|Well, they were the unlucky ones.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_226.wav|There is no excuse.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_228.wav|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_229.wav|But it's a subtle process.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_230.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_231.wav|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_232.wav|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_233.wav|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_234.wav|It is hard won.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_235.wav|Our policy is clear.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_236.wav|The scene is about this?|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_237.wav|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_238.wav|There wasn't a goal.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_239.wav|I should think so, too.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_240.wav|There's the mix.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_241.wav|The concerns are the same.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_242.wav|I can't get a job.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_243.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_244.wav|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_245.wav|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_246.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_248.wav|Is that a serious question?|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_249.wav|This is the first step.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_250.wav|They must play for each other.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_251.wav|Souter will be back.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_252.wav|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.|50,,
wav48/p277/p277_253.wav|Blood samples were taken.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_254.wav|They want to shut the Scottish Office.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_255.wav|We shall rely on human beings.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_256.wav|This is a question of Islam.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_257.wav|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_258.wav|Immediate action must be taken.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_259.wav|It's very nice.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_260.wav|He was also married with two children.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_261.wav|The system can work.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_262.wav|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_263.wav|We're in shock.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_264.wav|Our objective is to tackle poverty.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_265.wav|It's a way of life.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_266.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_267.wav|It was very fast.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_268.wav|The record companies have gone through the floor.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_269.wav|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_270.wav|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_271.wav|If not, he should go home.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_272.wav|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_273.wav|He looked very sharp.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_274.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_275.wav|All options are open.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_276.wav|Dialogue is the key.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_277.wav|They have shown a great desire and attitude.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_278.wav|It was a virus.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_279.wav|Maloney is an engaging talent.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_280.wav|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_281.wav|This is a national crisis.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_282.wav|It was good.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_283.wav|Who did the recruiting?|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_284.wav|Bombing slaughter rejected|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_285.wav|The songs are just so good.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_286.wav|The goals will come.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_287.wav|There's a pause.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_288.wav|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_289.wav|I was the sheep.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_290.wav|What has altered?|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_291.wav|I was brought up in a mining background.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_292.wav|Nothing is safe.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_293.wav|It would still have been a good film, but very different.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_294.wav|One was a lawyer.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_295.wav|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_296.wav|They are wrong.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_297.wav|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_298.wav|The plot is minimal.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_299.wav|You are the glory.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_300.wav|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.|50,,
wav48/p277/p277_301.wav|The letters are going out today.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_302.wav|We want to play at the worlds.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_303.wav|He is also keen to win the European order of merit.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_304.wav|My whole life has changed.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_305.wav|We are a peaceful people.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_306.wav|You may have a short memory.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_307.wav|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_308.wav|My body is clearly capable.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_309.wav|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_310.wav|It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_311.wav|A review is under way.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_312.wav|It will work.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_313.wav|I came into this world with nothing.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_314.wav|It's too horrible to think.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_315.wav|We think all other measures are not exhausted.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_316.wav|Off with their heads.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_317.wav|Is there a new way forward?|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_318.wav|I was invited to work in Germany.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_319.wav|Is that an issue?|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_320.wav|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_321.wav|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_322.wav|The same things will happen with GM foods.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_323.wav|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_324.wav|It sounded as if it might well be tragic.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_325.wav|Well, it won't.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_326.wav|These days are long gone.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_327.wav|Two people were interviewed.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_328.wav|I've got no secret.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_329.wav|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_330.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_331.wav|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_332.wav|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.|50,,
wav48/p277/p277_333.wav|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_334.wav|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_335.wav|He loves the big occasions.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_336.wav|The performance was excellent.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_337.wav|That has been lost.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_338.wav|Tell us about it.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_339.wav|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_340.wav|She said they would appeal.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_341.wav|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_342.wav|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_343.wav|Both of those promises have already been honoured.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_344.wav|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_346.wav|As, indeed, they would be.|50,,
wav48/p277/p277_347.wav|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_348.wav|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_349.wav|We will be homeless.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_350.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_351.wav|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_352.wav|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_353.wav|There was a substantial explosion.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_354.wav|Not so, it seems.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_355.wav|He could make it.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_356.wav|Four policemen were wounded.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_357.wav|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_358.wav|It's now down in black and white.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_359.wav|Now, though, he has an incentive.|50,,
wav48/p277/p277_360.wav|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_361.wav|They have not done so this season so far.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_362.wav|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_363.wav|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_364.wav|So there, we won.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_365.wav|By that time, however, it was already too late.|50,,
wav48/p277/p277_366.wav|There is no signature.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_367.wav|It was a funny game.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_368.wav|He was the architect.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_369.wav|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_370.wav|I've never seen a game like it.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_371.wav|I am a wealthy person.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_372.wav|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_373.wav|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.|50,,
wav48/p277/p277_374.wav|The Cabinet is split over the issue.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_375.wav|Something is wrong.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_376.wav|You can cope with it.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_377.wav|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_378.wav|That's the name of the game, though.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_379.wav|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_380.wav|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_381.wav|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_382.wav|At the last I found a bunker.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_383.wav|Yet the data is compelling.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_384.wav|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_385.wav|It's a real problem.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_386.wav|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_387.wav|I was in the train station overnight.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_388.wav|It is unusual.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_389.wav|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_390.wav|It's like a basketball.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_391.wav|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.|50,,
wav48/p277/p277_392.wav|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_393.wav|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_394.wav|It was a kind of contempt.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_395.wav|It was a breathtaking moment.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_396.wav|The car was just there.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_397.wav|It will take place in July.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_398.wav|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_399.wav|Is that possible?|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_400.wav|But, in fact, the reverse is true.|50,,
wav48/p277/p277_401.wav|What was the difference between them?|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_402.wav|Emotions were complex.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_403.wav|Then , he laughs.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_404.wav|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_405.wav|It is an absolute nonsense.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_406.wav|They recorded their debut album in New York.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_407.wav|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_408.wav|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_409.wav|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_410.wav|Feel the air, the space.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_411.wav|He got his degree.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_412.wav|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_413.wav|went on sale.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_414.wav|But we finished the show.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_415.wav|Mentally, you have to be tough.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_416.wav|The people around me were fantastic.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_417.wav|I wanted to help the poor people in Edinburgh.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_418.wav|It is legally binding.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_419.wav|Is there any prospect of this happening?|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_420.wav|There's been a mistake.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_421.wav|We just got a phone call on Saturday night.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_422.wav|Eriksson would have approved.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_423.wav|I am extremely cautious.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_424.wav|It was little else.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_425.wav|It all began as an accident.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_426.wav|The MoD has denied any cover-up.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_427.wav|I know the worry over Iraq.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_428.wav|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_429.wav|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.|50,,
wav48/p277/p277_430.wav|The document argues that culture is at the heart of Scottish society.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_431.wav|We are all equal.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_432.wav|It's been a long, long journey.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_433.wav|We were used.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_434.wav|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.|50,,
wav48/p277/p277_435.wav|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.|50,,,
wav48/p277/p277_436.wav|They were not even allowed to see them.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_437.wav|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_438.wav|Horses are drawn by ballot.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_439.wav|It won the match.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_440.wav|And it showed.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_441.wav|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_442.wav|I hate the word.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_443.wav|Who would be in that desert?|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_444.wav|I was lost.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_445.wav|The children are fine.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_446.wav|They have to come up with a solution.|50,,,,
wav48/p277/p277_447.wav|That was the first time I worked with Richard.|50,,,,

wav48/p278/p278_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |51,,,
wav48/p278/p278_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |51,,
wav48/p278/p278_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |51,,
wav48/p278/p278_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |51,,,
wav48/p278/p278_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |51,,,
wav48/p278/p278_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |51,,,
wav48/p278/p278_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |51,,,
wav48/p278/p278_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |51,,
wav48/p278/p278_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|51,,

wav48/p278/p278_086.wav|It was clear on Thursday.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_087.wav|It's not a holiday time for football players.|51,,,,

wav48/p278/p278_094.wav|In the end we made too many errors.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_095.wav|That time is not now, however.|51,,,
wav48/p278/p278_096.wav|We created so many chances.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_097.wav|Our house was very small.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_098.wav|Why do it otherwise ?|51,,,,

wav48/p278/p278_106.wav|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_107.wav|I was just appalled at the way they behaved.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_108.wav|We have got a race.|51,,,,

wav48/p278/p278_122.wav|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_123.wav|However, the problem is the timing.|51,,,
wav48/p278/p278_124.wav|This is a frightening development.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_125.wav|Which can happen any time.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_126.wav|It was not a finale he would want to remember.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_127.wav|We had another last Tuesday.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_128.wav|I didn't feel under any pressure.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_129.wav|This should begin in October.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_130.wav|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_131.wav|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_132.wav|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_133.wav|That would open the gates of hell.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_134.wav|You've got to be vigilant.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_135.wav|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_136.wav|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_137.wav|Before it was an ordeal.|51,,,,

wav48/p278/p278_139.wav|I love the spectacle of cinema.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_140.wav|They could use a boost.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_141.wav|Frankly, it was worth the booking.|51,,,
wav48/p278/p278_142.wav|Anyone can do the sums.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_143.wav|Others are not so sure.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_144.wav|I have always loved the countryside.|51,,,,

wav48/p278/p278_146.wav|I haven't made any definite decisions.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_147.wav|There's always the next century.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_148.wav|There's only one team in Ayrshire.|51,,,,

wav48/p278/p278_153.wav|Its loss was an economic catastrophe for the whole of Moray.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_154.wav|It was by the numbers.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_155.wav|I knew he was good.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_156.wav|We will turn the corner.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_157.wav|Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.|51,,,,

wav48/p278/p278_161.wav|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_162.wav|So was the first half.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_163.wav|It's never great to finish second.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_164.wav|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.|51,,,,

wav48/p278/p278_174.wav|Are you going to win ?|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_175.wav|Was it the wife ?|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_176.wav|Why change it ?|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_177.wav|What do we want to do that for ?|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_178.wav|I always felt they played for me.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_179.wav|His team management was protective.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_180.wav|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_181.wav|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.|51,,,
wav48/p278/p278_182.wav|The outcome is now in our own hands.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_183.wav|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.|51,,,
wav48/p278/p278_184.wav|It is vital to clarify their role.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_185.wav|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_186.wav|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_187.wav|Says the Duke of York.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_188.wav|That's not fair to the supporters.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_189.wav|They need to look after themselves.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_190.wav|I've always been like that.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_191.wav|It could be done by experts and lawyers.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_192.wav|They were seriously after him.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_193.wav|But there's an upturn in the sector.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_194.wav|It shows the strength of the roots.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_195.wav|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_196.wav|It caused a lot of upset.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_197.wav|However, this idea is never developed.|51,,,
wav48/p278/p278_198.wav|I had come back from London.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_199.wav|Last night was a key episode.|51,,,,

wav48/p278/p278_201.wav|I wanted to put myself on the line.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_202.wav|I came home by ambulance.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_203.wav|We've had an enjoyable adventure.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_204.wav|It comes from reflection or thinking.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_205.wav|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.|51,,,
wav48/p278/p278_206.wav|We could soon be in that same position!|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_207.wav|It was a horrible thing to happen.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_208.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_209.wav|I am very realistic about these things.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_210.wav|I won't make an official complaint.|51,,,,

wav48/p278/p278_216.wav|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_217.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.|51,,,,

wav48/p278/p278_219.wav|It was important to win the singles.|51,,,,

wav48/p278/p278_330.wav|The party lasted all night.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_331.wav|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_332.wav|Much the same thing happens in a young company.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_333.wav|They come to enjoy themselves.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_334.wav|That meant the search was unlawful.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_335.wav|And he goes with it.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_336.wav|That reflected a tumble in banking shares across the board.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_337.wav|We are on a four-year mission.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_338.wav|The letters are going out today.|51,,,,

wav48/p278/p278_340.wav|Do you think we are a top nation ?|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_341.wav|How independent is that ?|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_342.wav|What form did that take ?|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_343.wav|What are they for ?|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_344.wav|Is there a waiting list ?|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_345.wav|The advisers had some discussions, but no conclusion was reached.|51,,,
wav48/p278/p278_346.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_347.wav|And he is immensely loyal.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_348.wav|It looks as though the issue, with The Scotsman is too sensitive.|51,,,
wav48/p278/p278_349.wav|Other musicians were found in retirement.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_350.wav|That is a trend which will be encouraged.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_351.wav|And it was this one.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_352.wav|Scottish Newcastle will report its interim figures tomorrow.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_353.wav|My view has now completely changed.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_354.wav|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_355.wav|He was at school in Devon.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_356.wav|Finally came the moment of truth.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_357.wav|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_358.wav|A crucial moment has arrived.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_359.wav|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.|51,,,
wav48/p278/p278_360.wav|Three years ago he would have been.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_361.wav|But we welcome this document.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_362.wav|It intends to do so on Wednesday.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_363.wav|His views are hardly surprising.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_364.wav|He expected a conclusion by next Thursday.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_365.wav|The Allies intend to maintain the average.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_366.wav|We put our bid in last night.|51,,,,

wav48/p278/p278_368.wav|We're still the only ones in the High Street.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_369.wav|I was delighted to accept.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_370.wav|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.|51,,,
wav48/p278/p278_371.wav|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.|51,,,
wav48/p278/p278_372.wav|The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_373.wav|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.|51,,,
wav48/p278/p278_374.wav|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_375.wav|He must have seen the movie.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_376.wav|The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_377.wav|The major championships will always have a special place.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_378.wav|That is a break with tradition.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_379.wav|This decision is a farce.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_380.wav|Is it worth it ?|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_381.wav|Does it matter ?|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_382.wav|How do you take them away ?|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_383.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?|51,,
wav48/p278/p278_384.wav|After the match, do you ?|51,,,
wav48/p278/p278_385.wav|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_386.wav|In due course the deal was done.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_387.wav|This remains the party's policy.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_388.wav|They will fight for everything.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_389.wav|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_390.wav|The team hadn't been picked.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_391.wav|One-third of the places are already taken.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_392.wav|I always knew she was funny.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_393.wav|The marshall at the turn was great.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_394.wav|There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_395.wav|They have not got anyone.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_396.wav|The law would appear to be on our side.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_397.wav|It has happened for generations.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_398.wav|The hope is that the outcome will be equally successful.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_399.wav|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_400.wav|There's still no-one like him.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_401.wav|They know it'll be fantastic.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_402.wav|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_403.wav|Clark is back on top form.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_404.wav|I had a fortunate war.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_405.wav|We must improve our relations with government.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_406.wav|The Cabinet is split over the issue.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_407.wav|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_408.wav|That is the ultimate revenge.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_409.wav|The next few months will tell.|51,,,,
wav48/p278/p278_410.wav|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.|51,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |52,,
wav48/p279/p279_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |52,,
wav48/p279/p279_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |52,,
wav48/p279/p279_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |52,,
wav48/p279/p279_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|52,,
wav48/p279/p279_025.wav|It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_026.wav|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_027.wav|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_028.wav|They should be so lucky.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_029.wav|Is this accurate?|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_030.wav|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_031.wav|There's a story, too.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_032.wav|People love to see this stuff.|52,,,,

wav48/p279/p279_046.wav|We will push.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_047.wav|That period was a struggle.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_048.wav|It is urgent.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_049.wav|It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_050.wav|The judge said.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_051.wav|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_052.wav|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_053.wav|It's a blessing.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_054.wav|But it might have done.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_055.wav|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_056.wav|As she explains.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_057.wav|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_058.wav|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_059.wav|Life is good.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_060.wav|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_061.wav|Here's a clue.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_062.wav|He had no enemies.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_063.wav|Sadly, it can't.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_064.wav|We have not given up hope.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_065.wav|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_066.wav|That's the truth.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_067.wav|They were too hard.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_068.wav|The problems are a result of that shortfall.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_069.wav|Art is extra.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_070.wav|They're appalled by that.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_071.wav|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_072.wav|Scotland had great assets.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_073.wav|He was popular.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_074.wav|Have a look at our accounts.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_075.wav|It is like a river running by my home.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_076.wav|The end result is precisely the same.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_077.wav|It seemed so personal.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_078.wav|Painful, but only because it's true.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_079.wav|He had been a singer.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_080.wav|I've been there.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_081.wav|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_082.wav|Both sides have been hit by injury.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_083.wav|She died in hospital two hours later.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_084.wav|Is there a new way forward?|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_085.wav|It works for us.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_086.wav|It is a time bomb.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_087.wav|This is the way things should be handled.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_088.wav|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_089.wav|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_090.wav|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_091.wav|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_092.wav|They lived for their children.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_093.wav|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_094.wav|Yet, it worked.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_095.wav|This reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_096.wav|It is an old family habit.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_097.wav|Until you hit the big games.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_098.wav|The peace process will be buried!|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_099.wav|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_100.wav|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_101.wav|The selection process is still at a very early stage.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_102.wav|However, we have not come to any conclusions.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_103.wav|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_104.wav|I see no need for change.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_105.wav|That would be unlawful.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_106.wav|I didn't play well last year.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_107.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_108.wav|They will want to perform well.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_109.wav|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_110.wav|I don't have many friends.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_111.wav|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_112.wav|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_113.wav|I was angry.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_114.wav|This is a step backwards.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_115.wav|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_116.wav|This film will be totally awesome.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_117.wav|My office is bare.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_118.wav|Does this mean.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_119.wav|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_120.wav|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_121.wav|Who would have?|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_122.wav|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_123.wav|We work on the same level.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_124.wav|You can spend money on housing.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_125.wav|I felt very strongly that England should have it.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_126.wav|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_127.wav|I'm so angry.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_128.wav|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_129.wav|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_130.wav|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_131.wav|Well, you can have a tree.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_132.wav|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.|52,,
wav48/p279/p279_133.wav|Because it's a waste of time for both sides.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_134.wav|It will be too hot.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_135.wav|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_136.wav|I am now unemployed.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_137.wav|You've got to be vigilant.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_138.wav|It's perfectly feasible.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_139.wav|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_140.wav|This represents a tough game for us.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_141.wav|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_142.wav|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_143.wav|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_144.wav|Is that Titanic?|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_145.wav|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_146.wav|It is like a football team.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_147.wav|I am just trying to do my job.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_148.wav|They did very well.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_149.wav|You know the type.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_150.wav|In each case they were a goal down.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_151.wav|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_152.wav|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_153.wav|It was the same at Twickenham.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_154.wav|We also enjoyed a lot of support.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_155.wav|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_156.wav|This latter point is hugely important.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_157.wav|I am very happy with life.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_158.wav|These days are long gone.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_159.wav|It is an attitude of mind.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_160.wav|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_161.wav|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_162.wav|As, indeed, they would be.|52,,
wav48/p279/p279_163.wav|I have got a wife to feed.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_164.wav|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_165.wav|Tell it like it was?|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_166.wav|It is not too late to get on board.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_167.wav|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.|52,,
wav48/p279/p279_168.wav|By then, however, both men were already in the US.|52,,
wav48/p279/p279_169.wav|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_170.wav|Nobody did in those days.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_171.wav|My life has been destroyed.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_172.wav|His team management was protective.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_173.wav|Is Saddam a threat?|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_174.wav|We wanted it left for a wee while.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_175.wav|But the petrol station does not get the benefit.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_176.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_177.wav|The clarity is vital.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_178.wav|The hotel was now for sale.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_179.wav|I drove the ball well.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_180.wav|That has been the easy part.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_181.wav|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_182.wav|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_183.wav|Government will intervene.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_184.wav|We knew nothing about it.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_185.wav|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.|52,,
wav48/p279/p279_186.wav|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_187.wav|It's a joke.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_188.wav|Does this matter?|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_189.wav|It just came into my head that day.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_190.wav|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_191.wav|It was an odd affair, in many respects.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_192.wav|It is tough, but possible.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_193.wav|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_194.wav|The procedure is the same in all cases.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_195.wav|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_196.wav|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_197.wav|It was typical.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_198.wav|Our strategy is straightforward.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_199.wav|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_200.wav|I have a cold.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_201.wav|Tommy is not a problem.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_202.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_203.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_204.wav|He had suffered a heart attack.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_205.wav|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_206.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.|52,,
wav48/p279/p279_207.wav|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_208.wav|There was no rescue.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_209.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_210.wav|I don't want to use it.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_211.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_212.wav|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_213.wav|The road was closed for several hours.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_214.wav|That is an important part of our role.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_215.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_216.wav|I am delighted for Simon.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_217.wav|By hard work, is the answer.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_218.wav|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_219.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_220.wav|His death was a tragic accident.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_221.wav|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_222.wav|He's a nice guy.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_223.wav|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_224.wav|A career as a doctor is on hold.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_225.wav|I am immensely sad.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_226.wav|I'd never seen a play about me.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_227.wav|It is a gamble.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_228.wav|My neighbours are horrified.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_229.wav|At the time, he was a living legend.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_230.wav|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.|52,,
wav48/p279/p279_231.wav|They are the innocent victims.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_232.wav|Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_233.wav|Broke the birdie record.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_234.wav|Police later said the scheme would end in November.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_235.wav|It is set in Paris.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_236.wav|They should come forward.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_237.wav|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_238.wav|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_239.wav|You take a risk.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_240.wav|It's too much work.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_241.wav|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_242.wav|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_243.wav|He will go a long way.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_244.wav|We did not compete with any other local farmer.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_245.wav|The scene is about this?|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_246.wav|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_247.wav|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_248.wav|He's a lovely young man.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_249.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_250.wav|This year I understood.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_251.wav|This is the culture change in medicine.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_252.wav|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_253.wav|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.|52,,
wav48/p279/p279_254.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_255.wav|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_256.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_257.wav|This is a big club.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_258.wav|Blair is very positive at European Councils.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_259.wav|they fail to engage.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_260.wav|People should not become complacent.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_261.wav|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_262.wav|The warning is timely.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_263.wav|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_264.wav|Blood samples were taken.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_265.wav|It looks as though he will be right.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_266.wav|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_267.wav|I am totally horrified by the sentence.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_268.wav|It's very nice.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_269.wav|It left me with a sadness.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_270.wav|It was an easy decision to come here.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_271.wav|It is the same in Sweden.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_272.wav|That could be in place by next year.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_273.wav|Things can change.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_274.wav|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_275.wav|The script was funny.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_276.wav|They seem to get away with it.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_277.wav|She looked so young.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_278.wav|It happens from time to time.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_279.wav|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_280.wav|They expect the minister to ensure that commitment is honoured.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_281.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_282.wav|I intended to look for another club on loan.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_283.wav|You've got to have both sides.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_284.wav|The attacker died in the crash.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_285.wav|It was a virus.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_286.wav|Maloney is an engaging talent.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_287.wav|Who will perform?|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_288.wav|It's like a high school play.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_289.wav|It was hopeless.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_290.wav|I asked for a positive response and I was given one.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_291.wav|She said she could not believe that they had run away.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_292.wav|He wrote the letter two days before he died.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_293.wav|It changed my life.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_294.wav|These figures are truly awful.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_295.wav|He should have won.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_296.wav|Sunday's game was not a trial.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_297.wav|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_298.wav|What has altered?|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_299.wav|Graeme was prepared.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_300.wav|I thought it was my only chance.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_301.wav|One was a lawyer.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_302.wav|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_303.wav|They are wrong.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_304.wav|This is a war over our home.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_305.wav|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_306.wav|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_307.wav|It was entirely justified.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_308.wav|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_309.wav|It's certainly different.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_310.wav|The letters are going out today.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_311.wav|I did not name it.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_312.wav|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_313.wav|Special measures were needed.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_314.wav|It is all credit to them today.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_315.wav|They were fantastic.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_316.wav|Craig is a major concern for us.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_317.wav|My body is clearly capable.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_318.wav|I came into this world with nothing.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_319.wav|The airport was even different.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_320.wav|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_321.wav|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_322.wav|He got the same story.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_323.wav|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_324.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_325.wav|She did not attend the courtroom.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_326.wav|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_327.wav|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_328.wav|Was this element always there?|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_329.wav|They haven't got a hope.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_330.wav|He did a good job.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_331.wav|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_332.wav|It is so unfair.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_333.wav|It will be very, very tight.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_334.wav|That is the very reason why it was so vital.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_335.wav|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_336.wav|The composer will conduct.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_337.wav|It's always nice to play on Centre Court.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_338.wav|Alex Ferguson is the same.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_339.wav|The boat was fantastic.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_340.wav|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_341.wav|Like his acting, it was an accident.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_342.wav|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_343.wav|You need a licence to run a pub.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_344.wav|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_345.wav|The salary changes are long overdue.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_346.wav|The decision is an absolute disgrace.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_347.wav|It is horrible.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_348.wav|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_349.wav|I kept going for her.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_350.wav|He has seen the past.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_351.wav|Hartley should know.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_352.wav|We are looking for perfection.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_353.wav|It's not pretty, but it's effective.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_354.wav|It's that sort of night.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_355.wav|He could make it.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_356.wav|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_357.wav|I lost my head.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_358.wav|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_359.wav|It was a double tragedy for the family.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_360.wav|He put some colour into Scottish history.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_361.wav|Well, the big day has arrived.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_362.wav|So there, we won.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_363.wav|By that time, however, it was already too late.|52,,
wav48/p279/p279_364.wav|Breaking new ground is also very rewarding.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_365.wav|There is no signature.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_366.wav|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_367.wav|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_368.wav|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.|52,,
wav48/p279/p279_369.wav|He has the edge.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_370.wav|Again, we were lucky.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_371.wav|He denied the charge.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_372.wav|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_373.wav|It has been a lovely family occasion.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_374.wav|That's the name of the game, though.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_375.wav|YOU thought it was a headache.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_376.wav|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_377.wav|We have to reduce the number of plastic bags.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_378.wav|It doesn't always work that way.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_379.wav|I'm pleased about one thing.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_380.wav|We try to keep it right.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_381.wav|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_382.wav|It's like a basketball.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_383.wav|Stewart will travel with some confidence.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_384.wav|I can lead by example.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_385.wav|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_386.wav|He is on the wrong side.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_387.wav|It will probably take me just days to spend it.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_388.wav|I was in jail for five years.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_389.wav|It will take place in July.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_390.wav|However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.|52,,,
wav48/p279/p279_391.wav|The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_392.wav|I never won a penny throughout my career.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_393.wav|His remarks appear to have had an effect.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_394.wav|He's already made history.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_395.wav|So I did.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_396.wav|You ask the question.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_397.wav|Not because they want to sing about something.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_398.wav|You make the choice.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_399.wav|I have been in good form for the last two years.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_400.wav|A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_401.wav|Nobody even knew it had happened.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_402.wav|What would be the point?|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_403.wav|The weekly average was three hours.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_404.wav|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_405.wav|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.|52,,,,
wav48/p279/p279_406.wav|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.|52,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_001.wav|Please call Stella. |53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |53,,
wav48/p280/p280_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |53,,
wav48/p280/p280_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |53,,
wav48/p280/p280_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |53,,
wav48/p280/p280_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|53,,
wav48/p280/p280_025.wav|He has the right attitude but the wrong approach.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_026.wav|His secretary said it was a matter for Murray Financial to deal with.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_027.wav|I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_028.wav|The west coast line is not just for middle England.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_029.wav|The Budget is a boost for Scottish business.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_030.wav|She brought a lot to my life.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_031.wav|Things fall a little flat elsewhere, however.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_032.wav|Thomson and his family left court without comment.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_033.wav|I want to give everything to Rangers while I am with the club.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_034.wav|But the Sunday Herald said it stood by its story.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_035.wav|It is about control of our economy.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_036.wav|Each brand was owned by a different family.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_037.wav|That was not perfect golf by any means.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_038.wav|He added that her comments were noted.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_039.wav|She will get through it I'm sure.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_040.wav|Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_041.wav|Hearts hit back with two goals in four minutes.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_042.wav|He does not even trust his own members.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_043.wav|He too started on the subs seats.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_044.wav|Is it worth it ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_045.wav|Does it matter ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_046.wav|How do you take them away ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_047.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?|53,,
wav48/p280/p280_048.wav|After the match, do you ?|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_049.wav|Has the conflict started ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_050.wav|Have I really come to this ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_051.wav|I'm as fit as I can get.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_052.wav|We took part in a festival called Global Dance.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_053.wav|He said he still planned to go ahead with deep tax cuts.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_054.wav|The important retail business continues to deliver excellent results, Stewart said.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_055.wav|Andy was a huge influence yet again.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_056.wav|They seem too much of a sure thing.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_057.wav|Her husband had been waiting for her return.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_058.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_059.wav|We just want this season to end.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_060.wav|It was a day she thought she would never see.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_061.wav|Talks have continued at many different levels.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_062.wav|The referee is there to decide these things.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_063.wav|There were no details of the other five victims.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_064.wav|It also has a good labour supply.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_065.wav|Indeed he has a lot of output.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_066.wav|Do not give your details to anyone.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_067.wav|He was failed by his health authority.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_068.wav|But it was not all bad news.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_069.wav|I cannot believe that someone would pay so much for works like these.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_070.wav|But during the bid process, that changed completely.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_071.wav|It turned me against the whole system.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_072.wav|She seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_073.wav|I saw the story, but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_074.wav|But two groups refused to sign up.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_075.wav|I was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_076.wav|It had little effect on European equity markets.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_077.wav|I'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_078.wav|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_079.wav|The squad spent the night at police headquarters.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_080.wav|They said our costs were too high.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_081.wav|I do not attempt to answer that.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_082.wav|It's been a great evening for us.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_083.wav|That kind of growth is the important thing.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_084.wav|A regular bus service runs between the hall and the town centre.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_085.wav|No plans for projects are yet in place.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_086.wav|Clearly he knows nothing about Glasgow or Glasgow Green.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_087.wav|I have no problems playing with such capable players in front of me.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_088.wav|Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_089.wav|I feel I did not have enough time.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_090.wav|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_091.wav|I can't remember a lot about the accident.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_092.wav|Clark was delighted with the effort of Jones.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_093.wav|They had the appeal of TV stars.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_094.wav|There is no issue of national security involved here.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_095.wav|He will be a very hard act to follow.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_096.wav|Earlier, both main parties agreed a crucial stage had been reached.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_097.wav|Put simply, it goes something like this.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_098.wav|Over one million people have been forced from their homes.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_099.wav|Even if he doesn't have any lines.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_100.wav|I am delighted to hear this news.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_101.wav|We are already seeing some positive results.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_102.wav|We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_103.wav|We were under a bit of pressure.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_104.wav|They won't actually make any money from it.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_105.wav|I bought a flat six years ago.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_106.wav|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_107.wav|They are a different team at home.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_108.wav|It took around three minutes from beginning to end.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_109.wav|Scotland is never far away at Westminster.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_110.wav|Some young girls also came by last night.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_111.wav|Former Hamilton defender Colin Miller could return to the club today as manager.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_112.wav|What are they for ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_113.wav|Is there a waiting list ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_114.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_115.wav|So what happens next ?|53,,,,

wav48/p280/p280_117.wav|What do they want us to do ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_118.wav|The idea is the shop within a shop.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_119.wav|I left five minutes after he had finished his round.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_120.wav|It is the right package for Scotland.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_121.wav|They have no real friends in the region.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_122.wav|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_123.wav|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_124.wav|In Glasgow, a sheriff dismissed five cases yesterday without hearing evidence.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_125.wav|I think there's not much between them.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_126.wav|So I am going in the right direction.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_127.wav|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_128.wav|We have to offer value for money.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_129.wav|It's so nice to see the reaction on their faces.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_130.wav|I could live without the attention, he admitted.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_131.wav|He's got to look after himself now.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_132.wav|He said a review of the planning process should encourage fresh thinking.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_133.wav|No country has a similar training programme.|53,,,,

wav48/p280/p280_138.wav|We must pay teachers to take rugby in schools.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_139.wav|The programme has been made with great care.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_140.wav|There was only one living room, you see.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_141.wav|I am not under any new pressure.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_142.wav|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_143.wav|It appears that no holiday is complete without a good row.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_144.wav|They can break quickly from midfield and carry a scoring threat.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_145.wav|All eight victims were based in Germany.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_146.wav|Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_147.wav|You should feel involved in their lives.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_148.wav|It is open season on the Old Firm.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_149.wav|Is it in the right place ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_150.wav|Did he trip ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_151.wav|Does that put pressure on us ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_152.wav|Did it work ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_153.wav|Do you think we are a top nation ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_154.wav|Three senior officials were dismissed last week.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_155.wav|Time may already have run out for this option.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_156.wav|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_157.wav|When it happened, he could hardly believe it.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_158.wav|They let you see the world through a fresh pair of eyes.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_159.wav|As our national coach, Brown is done for.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_160.wav|A progress report will be published in October.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_161.wav|This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_162.wav|That will reduce my chance of selection.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_163.wav|When Germany played there recently, the match took place in the new stadium.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_164.wav|Surely it can't run for two years.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_165.wav|But the game is still wide open.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_166.wav|It is no good thinking about Rangers at this time.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_167.wav|However, it's possible that Dick can influence some Dutch players to go there.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_168.wav|I knew that I needed to lower my ball flight.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_169.wav|We had to work very hard for our points.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_170.wav|That is a big risk at any price.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_171.wav|You need a long-term strategy in football.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_172.wav|He said some things which were better left alone.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_173.wav|If successful, several records will be made.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_174.wav|The company hopes to top seven million passengers in its current financial year.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_175.wav|It didn't come as any great surprise.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_176.wav|Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_177.wav|It's just a different way of life.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_178.wav|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_179.wav|Nato has left them with no other option.|53,,,,

wav48/p280/p280_189.wav|The story was not made public by this club.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_190.wav|That capital would be provided equally by the State and established commercial companies.|53,,,,

wav48/p280/p280_192.wav|I am fighting the force of nature.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_193.wav|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_194.wav|Murray spent the early part of his career elsewhere.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_195.wav|And they were being paid ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_196.wav|was everything done to save people ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_197.wav|What was the matter for concern ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_198.wav|But they had to be paid for.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_199.wav|There was no way back for Rangers after that blow.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_200.wav|The police insisted that they were standard issue.|53,,,,

wav48/p280/p280_208.wav|Gas production was also at record levels last year.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_209.wav|They are a victim of their own success.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_210.wav|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_211.wav|This is a young squad and we're all supporters.|53,,,,

wav48/p280/p280_216.wav|I am not going to judge them.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_217.wav|I do not see this so much as failure.|53,,,,

wav48/p280/p280_226.wav|If not, a deal could take many months.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_227.wav|This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_228.wav|Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_229.wav|I want to see as much progress as possible.|53,,,,

wav48/p280/p280_239.wav|Jim was down there with his wife.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_240.wav|Was it the wife ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_241.wav|Why change it ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_242.wav|What do we want to do that for ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_243.wav|Does the name matter ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_244.wav|how do you get it back ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_245.wav|What are you not good at ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_246.wav|I think, therefore I am ?|53,,,

wav48/p280/p280_248.wav|The pair will meet again in Glasgow, and then train together in Australia.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_249.wav|My first New Year's wish is for him to change his mind.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_250.wav|He has many offers from the English Premiership.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_251.wav|However, the figures tell a different story.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_252.wav|The rise has come too late for some.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_253.wav|Rangers then had a couple of good efforts.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_254.wav|I'd rather play well next week than here.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_255.wav|Edinburgh Prison will also require to be seen.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_256.wav|The British Government should follow the Irish example.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_257.wav|Commercial producers were present in large numbers.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_258.wav|Despite his success, things began to fall apart.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_259.wav|Policy making would become a role for ministers and their officials.|53,,,,

wav48/p280/p280_270.wav|Its primary business channel is the internet.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_271.wav|That's been the difference between the sides.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_272.wav|The lack of joint action left many analysts concerned.|53,,,,

wav48/p280/p280_284.wav|The fans pay for their season tickets.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_285.wav|There was just fire all around me.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_286.wav|In fact, I have been a bit of a terrorist to the council.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_287.wav|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_288.wav|No-one had seen this sort of thing before.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_289.wav|We played well at Aberdeen, though we lost.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_290.wav|He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.|53,,,,

wav48/p280/p280_294.wav|The agreement remains the only show in town.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_295.wav|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_296.wav|The strong performance is expected to continue.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_297.wav|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_298.wav|It is based on population rather than need.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_299.wav|He could understand both points of view.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_300.wav|So, did she meet him ?|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_301.wav|So what is the campaign about ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_302.wav|And does it ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_303.wav|Are you from the rugby ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_304.wav|Had I heard ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_305.wav|What happened in that game ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_306.wav|Are you going to win ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_307.wav|It might have led to a screen career, but it didn't.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_308.wav|Further heavy charges are expected this year.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_309.wav|It had happened on average once a week this year.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_310.wav|This is the version which appeared in our paper.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_311.wav|He is keen to stay in public service.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_312.wav|Of course people will try the things they see on TV.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_313.wav|For that reason cover should not be given.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_314.wav|He felt too close to head office.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_315.wav|If you believe in the blue and white.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_316.wav|A report on their property is due within days.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_317.wav|He will just go on doing his job.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_318.wav|I always felt they played for me.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_319.wav|That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.|53,,,,

wav48/p280/p280_321.wav|This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_322.wav|We will not simply hit these people.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_323.wav|We still think this trade is on the increase.|53,,,,

wav48/p280/p280_325.wav|His name was first linked last year to Business for Scotland.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_326.wav|I feel as if I can hole everything now.|53,,,,

wav48/p280/p280_328.wav|He is not exactly a pretty child.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_329.wav|I thought the race was a little bit slow.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_330.wav|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_331.wav|Having a Scot play against us would not achieve that.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_332.wav|I felt it was time for me to leave to develop my career.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_333.wav|These options include the possible merger or sale of the company.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_334.wav|One royal, however, was himself criticised yesterday.|53,,
wav48/p280/p280_335.wav|Sports Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the action.|53,,,,

wav48/p280/p280_338.wav|How are you, sir ?|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_339.wav|So is that it, then ?|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_340.wav|Do I have a favourite ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_341.wav|Put another way, they just won't do it.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_342.wav|Perhaps she met her husband too early, she says.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_343.wav|Getting that balance right can be very difficult.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_344.wav|Martin O Neill called this game almost exactly right.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_345.wav|Neither police nor hotel management had any record of the incident.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_346.wav|It was a bit like having children.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_347.wav|And the top prize draw award is certainly impressive.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_348.wav|And that is the bottom line - box office.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_349.wav|I'm extremely confident something will happen within the next couple of days.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_350.wav|I think the guilty ones speak for the whole lot of us.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_351.wav|I think we are back on track.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_352.wav|Sales will begin by the end of October.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_353.wav|The executive has so far not offered any immediate prospect of major change.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_354.wav|Friday night was a pretty good night.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_355.wav|It is not a material issue for a group with our strength.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_356.wav|The deal is expected to be completed by September.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_357.wav|It is the only natural British site on the list.|53,,,,

wav48/p280/p280_360.wav|They have the cash and the fire power.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_361.wav|The institute board will take the decision.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_362.wav|He's young enough and he must learn.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_363.wav|Such a policy is for long-term strength.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_364.wav|Both players gave so much to the side.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_365.wav|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_366.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_367.wav|The dead woman and the injured man have not yet been named.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_368.wav|It was a goal which came from nothing.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_369.wav|We have a substantial value of assets on the ground.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_370.wav|I have come here to show support for the families.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_371.wav|We have been going for three years.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_372.wav|He really played us into a corner.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_373.wav|They know the truth, they really know the truth.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_374.wav|It was another black day for Ayrshire.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_375.wav|Otherwise, we might as well hold it now.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_376.wav|It used to be all hard sell.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_377.wav|The direct effects on trade will be limited.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_378.wav|He had got himself into trouble with money and needed money.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_379.wav|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_380.wav|This is an audience determined to enjoy themselves.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_381.wav|This is not a small amount of money.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_382.wav|The doctors say that he will be fine for the performance next week.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_383.wav|I just felt that I was broken down.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_384.wav|What do we do ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_385.wav|Why do it otherwise ?|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_386.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_387.wav|The cost of this failure will not hit the Commission.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_388.wav|Similar increases have been experienced by the medical defence unions.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_389.wav|He remains a main board director of Royal.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_390.wav|His record on Government has always been highly effective.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_391.wav|My tax affairs have been totally open.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_392.wav|Five years ago its return was rejected.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_393.wav|But soon the game dropped back into its old ways.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_394.wav|In my opinion, any transfer to a foreign club will help him progress.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_395.wav|In that situation, they thought we should be beaten.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_396.wav|We are keen to see truth and justice.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_397.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.|53,,,
wav48/p280/p280_398.wav|People have a wish to charge twice.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_399.wav|I think it's a big advantage to us.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_400.wav|There were no hard words between us.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_401.wav|Today he will meet the Italian press but he will give little away.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_402.wav|Every blood test on sheep in Scotland has been completely clear.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_403.wav|These old songs are very nice to play.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_404.wav|My views on the decision are well known.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_405.wav|I'd never seen a play about me.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_406.wav|We were on top and could have won.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_407.wav|Some would say that that culture had been created already.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_408.wav|So it looks like a done deal.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_409.wav|The play was to go straight ahead.|53,,,,
wav48/p280/p280_410.wav|At the core of these issues are real people with real jobs.|53,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |54,,
wav48/p281/p281_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |54,,
wav48/p281/p281_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |54,,
wav48/p281/p281_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |54,,
wav48/p281/p281_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|54,,
wav48/p281/p281_025.wav|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_026.wav|They are very clever in their use of words.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_027.wav|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_028.wav|Smoking is also very important.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_029.wav|It's not going to work out that way.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_030.wav|They've got their own agenda.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_031.wav|I'd just like to play.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_032.wav|Our fans have been marvellous.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_033.wav|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_034.wav|He should emerge as the winner.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_035.wav|She failed in her action.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_036.wav|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_037.wav|It carried a double message.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_038.wav|It is a financial matter.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_039.wav|This film will be totally awesome.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_040.wav|They want to be entertained.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_041.wav|A week is a long time in politics.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_042.wav|I am just going to go for it.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_043.wav|There's been a wake up call for the sector this week.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_044.wav|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.|54,,
wav48/p281/p281_045.wav|Among them are many criminals.|54,,,,

wav48/p281/p281_047.wav|He looks like an Afghan.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_048.wav|That was the theory, anyway.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_049.wav|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_050.wav|I had come back from London.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_051.wav|Pulled a huge number of viewers.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_052.wav|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_053.wav|I must take a seat.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_054.wav|That is very hard, alone.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_055.wav|The Government should be ashamed.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_056.wav|None has ever been found.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_057.wav|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_058.wav|We should be able to cope.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_059.wav|It was a lovely experience.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_060.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_061.wav|We will pay their bills.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_062.wav|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.|54,,
wav48/p281/p281_063.wav|The standard is extremely high.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_064.wav|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_065.wav|Only water is currently allowed.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_066.wav|The tournament has now been cancelled.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_067.wav|It is a real problem.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_068.wav|I have proved that in the past.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_069.wav|He had been a singer.|54,,,,

wav48/p281/p281_071.wav|How are you, sir ?|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_072.wav|So is that it, then ?|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_073.wav|Do I have a favourite ?|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_074.wav|The players will be down.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_075.wav|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_076.wav|There could be a lot of confusion.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_077.wav|He also received a medal of honour.|54,,,,

wav48/p281/p281_082.wav|Last week, he was taken into hospital.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_083.wav|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_084.wav|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_085.wav|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.|54,,
wav48/p281/p281_086.wav|The error appeared in a warrant.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_087.wav|He liked the weather, the courses, the food.|54,,
wav48/p281/p281_088.wav|The cut is excellent news for the consumer.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_089.wav|IT is called a killing in the trade.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_090.wav|It was worth a photograph.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_091.wav|We could not get any possession.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_092.wav|Officers recovered a second body in the area.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_093.wav|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_094.wav|The conclusion is the same.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_095.wav|It is a vicious circle.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_096.wav|But I know the course.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_097.wav|We must stop it with the golf ball.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_098.wav|We live by the rule of law.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_099.wav|This is a national crisis.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_100.wav|Otherwise, the market may come back.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_101.wav|The following are the principal provisions.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_102.wav|Movement has to take place.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_103.wav|City sentiment is in his favour.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_104.wav|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_105.wav|It's not a lack of confidence.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_106.wav|It was a funny game.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_107.wav|What do we do ?|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_108.wav|Why do it otherwise ?|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_109.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_110.wav|That is the only way forward.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_111.wav|They are at a very early stage.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_112.wav|The whole thing is the music.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_113.wav|Or it would have been.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_114.wav|His is a success story by any standard.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_115.wav|Its replacement was not used in the exercise.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_116.wav|Such actions are rarely popular.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_117.wav|I've heard this stuff about the markets.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_118.wav|It is much as it has been described.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_119.wav|They've got to account for it.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_120.wav|Then again, we could have.|54,,,

wav48/p281/p281_127.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.|54,,,,

wav48/p281/p281_129.wav|They made such decisions in London.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_130.wav|There were no serious injuries.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_131.wav|She was also very brave.|54,,,,

wav48/p281/p281_133.wav|First meeting was next week.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_134.wav|I never wanted a legal battle.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_135.wav|We will try to find someone.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_136.wav|People come from all round the world to see it.|54,,,,

wav48/p281/p281_138.wav|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_139.wav|But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_140.wav|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_141.wav|It is not just about pay.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_142.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_143.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_144.wav|I was caught out a little bit.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_145.wav|The FBI could become involved.|54,,,,

wav48/p281/p281_147.wav|Three hours later, the man was free.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_148.wav|We have a clean bill of health.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_149.wav|It is not normal practice.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_150.wav|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.|54,,,

wav48/p281/p281_159.wav|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_160.wav|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_161.wav|The strong pound also took its toll.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_162.wav|It is a terrible tragedy.|54,,,,

wav48/p281/p281_172.wav|They could not match it.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_173.wav|To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_174.wav|Do not imagine for a moment that they are not there.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_175.wav|One season, they might do well.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_176.wav|You've got to be vigilant.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_177.wav|The second aspect was the fear of failure.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_178.wav|I feel like my game has come a long way.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_179.wav|The Hibs manager is no fool.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_180.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_181.wav|If that's the case, he will struggle.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_182.wav|The hotel was now for sale.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_183.wav|I can't even get into the A team.|54,,,,

wav48/p281/p281_188.wav|The new scheme will have its own terms and conditions.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_189.wav|Our destiny is in our own hands.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_190.wav|He prefers to play for them.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_191.wav|I have accepted the challenge.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_192.wav|You know the sort of thing.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_193.wav|They were seriously after him.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_194.wav|It was an odd affair, in many respects.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_195.wav|And this game is all about belief.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_196.wav|Aberdeen had little to offer.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_197.wav|That would be my view.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_198.wav|It decided to blame the media.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_199.wav|We always felt we could win.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_200.wav|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_201.wav|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_202.wav|It's very difficult to find a buyer.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_203.wav|Because he was born in England.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_204.wav|There was no way back for United after that.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_205.wav|It was a test in itself.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_206.wav|No details of the talks were given.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_207.wav|This will be our new beginning.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_208.wav|They have the cash and the fire power.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_209.wav|We believe a third party was involved.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_210.wav|Tommy is not a problem.|54,,,,

wav48/p281/p281_218.wav|You are a great player.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_219.wav|What do we want to do that for ?|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_220.wav|Does the name matter ?|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_221.wav|how do you get it back ?|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_222.wav|What are you not good at ?|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_223.wav|You have got to look at speed of response.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_224.wav|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_225.wav|We're very unhappy about it.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_226.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_227.wav|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_228.wav|I had relied on him.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_229.wav|I'm just a regular person.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_230.wav|It had all been arranged.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_231.wav|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_232.wav|I am considered a teenager.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_233.wav|Anyway, the job will be part-time.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_234.wav|This will secure the future of our industry.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_235.wav|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_236.wav|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_237.wav|It was a crazy day.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_238.wav|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_239.wav|That has been the easy part.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_240.wav|You could feel the heat.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_241.wav|We played them off the pitch.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_242.wav|After that nothing could save him.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_243.wav|This is the year of the Tiger.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_244.wav|Wilson will tell the truth.|54,,,,

wav48/p281/p281_249.wav|He has run a hell of a race.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_250.wav|That is still in place.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_251.wav|Half of young people had had contact with the police.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_252.wav|The irony was not lost.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_253.wav|The pig industry is on its knees.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_254.wav|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_255.wav|The minister is the engineer.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_256.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_257.wav|She took them for a term.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_258.wav|Kingfisher can afford to wait.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_259.wav|You can never tell with the manager.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_260.wav|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_261.wav|Persuaded to change his mind.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_262.wav|Either way, the investor retains the premium.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_263.wav|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_264.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_265.wav|I should think so, too.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_266.wav|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_267.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_268.wav|That would depend on the parole board.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_269.wav|The capital costs are modest.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_270.wav|That could be in place by next year.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_271.wav|On the contrary they stand to gain.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_272.wav|He looked like a schoolboy.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_273.wav|England could only play the other team on the park.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_274.wav|He took over our lives.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_275.wav|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_276.wav|We feel very good about it.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_277.wav|It does not work that way in Scottish football.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_278.wav|For him then it's a labour of love.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_279.wav|We are aiming for early March.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_280.wav|It is also very valuable.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_281.wav|The demand is created by the supply.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_282.wav|Not many companies can say that these days.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_283.wav|I realised I was lucky to have it.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_284.wav|That view has not altered.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_285.wav|And they were being paid ?|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_286.wav|was everything done to save people ?|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_287.wav|What was the matter for concern ?|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_288.wav|Do I think about them often ?|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_289.wav|It has the potential to be another North Sea.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_290.wav|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_291.wav|He was also married with two children.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_292.wav|The target is to break even by Christmas.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_293.wav|You have to expect this type of thing.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_294.wav|They seem to get away with it.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_295.wav|We have to be very, very careful.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_296.wav|The partnership was set up during the summer.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_297.wav|It is a symbolic concert.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_298.wav|Hopefully, this week will be good.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_299.wav|This is the correct decision.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_300.wav|He added that the business was in good shape.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_301.wav|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_302.wav|Scotch beef is badly missed.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_303.wav|The rescue package is public money.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_304.wav|We are not doing the Today programme.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_305.wav|There should be room for creative dissent.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_306.wav|These figures are truly awful.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_307.wav|We need to increase the membership.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_308.wav|The real issue is personal.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_309.wav|Their condition was described as stable yesterday.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_310.wav|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_311.wav|He was at home with his pals.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_312.wav|The dealer is on notice.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_313.wav|The party lasted all night.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_314.wav|We are in the end game.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_315.wav|They come to enjoy themselves.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_316.wav|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_317.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_318.wav|That meant the search was unlawful.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_319.wav|This may be perfectly innocent.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_320.wav|Scotland has shown the way.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_321.wav|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_322.wav|The letters are going out today.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_323.wav|I can see their argument.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_324.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_325.wav|It is all credit to them today.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_326.wav|The whole family was in shock.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_327.wav|That decision will be made over the next couple of days.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_328.wav|The actor has met with Mandela.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_329.wav|There is no shortage of farmers.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_330.wav|It's difficult to predict the future.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_331.wav|It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_332.wav|But the Farmer is bemused.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_333.wav|To beat the European champion is quite nice.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_334.wav|However, the groups denied the claims.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_335.wav|The airport was even different.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_336.wav|There was no time scale.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_337.wav|Does that put pressure on us ?|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_338.wav|Did it work ?|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_339.wav|Do you think we are a top nation ?|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_340.wav|In his absence, the council adopted the change.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_341.wav|It's just the way I play.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_342.wav|The figures are bad, but not that bad.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_343.wav|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_344.wav|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_345.wav|I have a moral dilemma.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_346.wav|It was almost too much.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_347.wav|It will now be unveiled in the US in July.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_348.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_349.wav|The idea was first mooted a year ago.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_350.wav|He did a good job.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_351.wav|It's a policy which has worked for us.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_352.wav|It intends to do so on Wednesday.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_353.wav|I think this proposal is excellent.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_354.wav|The Allies intend to maintain the average.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_355.wav|He deserves a top team.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_356.wav|It is all about having physical evidence.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_357.wav|It should be a great game, though.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_358.wav|I said she was very young.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_359.wav|He had no previous convictions.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_360.wav|Alex Ferguson is the same.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_361.wav|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_362.wav|Neither woman has been named.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_363.wav|They should take their mobile phones.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_364.wav|You need a licence to run a pub.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_365.wav|I got a yellow card.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_366.wav|There will be no final dividend.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_367.wav|I believe the gap is nearly there.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_368.wav|The major championships will always have a special place.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_369.wav|She said they would appeal.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_370.wav|They were to blame for the first two goals.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_371.wav|There is no deal as yet.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_372.wav|It's as wide as a church in here.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_373.wav|The shares are a strong hold.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_374.wav|It would be quite nice.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_375.wav|There was a thing in front of the camera.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_376.wav|The pair are very much in love.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_377.wav|Everything is now in place for Manchester.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_378.wav|We are delighted at the response from potential employers.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_379.wav|No other job in world football can compare to this one.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_380.wav|I wanted to go out on a high.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_381.wav|He has seen the past.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_382.wav|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_383.wav|He has an equity stake in the investment house.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_384.wav|Our policy is very clear on this issue.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_385.wav|He has been a success this year.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_386.wav|In fact, he was great today.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_387.wav|Now, though, he has an incentive.|54,,
wav48/p281/p281_388.wav|A review is under way.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_389.wav|It is a simple equation.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_390.wav|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_391.wav|I was as strong as a horse.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_392.wav|I had a fortunate war.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_393.wav|Are they free ?|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_394.wav|What are they for ?|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_395.wav|Is there a waiting list ?|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_396.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_397.wav|That investment has now been secured.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_398.wav|He had returned to die.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_399.wav|It is hard to understand.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_400.wav|Adventure is the champagne of life.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_401.wav|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_402.wav|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_403.wav|The casualties were not named.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_404.wav|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_405.wav|It had been on the cards.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_406.wav|He took a draw on his cigarette.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_407.wav|It was the same expression of joy.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_408.wav|There is a solution, she believes.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_409.wav|Yet the data is compelling.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_410.wav|That was a touch of class.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_411.wav|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_412.wav|That is a personal matter.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_413.wav|He seems to be used to the attention.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_414.wav|We will stand for the nation.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_415.wav|Is it worth it ?|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_416.wav|Does it matter ?|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_417.wav|How do you take them away ?|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_418.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?|54,,
wav48/p281/p281_419.wav|After the match, do you ?|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_420.wav|I am delighted for them.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_421.wav|Footballers have also been targeted.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_422.wav|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_423.wav|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_424.wav|My aim is a top six finish.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_425.wav|That's the way it works.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_426.wav|The professor is in no doubt.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_427.wav|It was a poor performance.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_428.wav|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_429.wav|John Daly has a burning ambition.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_430.wav|Once again, they would be wrong.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_431.wav|Together, we can make a difference.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_432.wav|He will be judged by his actions.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_433.wav|It is an absolute nonsense.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_434.wav|We might be back next year.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_435.wav|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_436.wav|Size is not the issue.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_437.wav|It was support as it should be.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_438.wav|I didn't get to keep it.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_439.wav|It is never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_440.wav|THE boy in The Sixth Sense is not alone.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_441.wav|He deserves a second chance.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_442.wav|It is pretty bad news.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_443.wav|We just thought it would be kept under the carpet.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_444.wav|Her body was found about four miles from the car.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_445.wav|We just got a phone call on Saturday night.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_446.wav|But we have built a platform for next season.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_447.wav|I was embarrassed by it.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_448.wav|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_449.wav|She came to the Highland Show.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_450.wav|Neither club is going to have much time for a decent runner-up.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_451.wav|We have the location, which is assured.|54,,,
wav48/p281/p281_452.wav|They were good years for him.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_453.wav|We're all paying for it.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_454.wav|This is the stuff of live music.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_455.wav|She has now been registered as disabled.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_456.wav|We could hardly believe it.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_457.wav|The men are very worried.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_458.wav|Both promotions come as no surprise.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_459.wav|We are going through the process.|54,,,,
wav48/p281/p281_460.wav|It must never be seen as second class.|54,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |55,,
wav48/p282/p282_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |55,,
wav48/p282/p282_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |55,,
wav48/p282/p282_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |55,,
wav48/p282/p282_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.|55,,
wav48/p282/p282_025.wav|But it failed.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_026.wav|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_027.wav|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_028.wav|However, the following year the cancer returned.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_029.wav|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|55,,
wav48/p282/p282_030.wav|This is the window.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_031.wav|He was jailed for five years.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_032.wav|Help is needed.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_033.wav|Then, suddenly, they weren't.|55,,
wav48/p282/p282_034.wav|It is marvellous.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_035.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_036.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_037.wav|They're just different.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_038.wav|It was clear.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_039.wav|Indeed, he does.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_040.wav|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_041.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.|55,,
wav48/p282/p282_042.wav|Dancing was her life.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_043.wav|The ambition this year is to improve on last.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_044.wav|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_045.wav|They want to be entertained.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_046.wav|It's the only thing.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_047.wav|You had better believe it.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_048.wav|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.|55,,
wav48/p282/p282_049.wav|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_050.wav|A neighbour said.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_051.wav|It is bizarre.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_052.wav|There is no reason at all.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_053.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_054.wav|Every aspect of our play was first class.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_055.wav|Our people are ready.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_056.wav|Here's a clue.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_057.wav|I was lost.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_058.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.|55,,
wav48/p282/p282_059.wav|My fitness was very poor.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_060.wav|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_061.wav|It is unique.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_062.wav|I expect a rapid response.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_063.wav|It happened so quickly.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_064.wav|That's the truth.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_065.wav|It seems to have worked.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_066.wav|This is the first step.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_067.wav|And if he hadn't become a musician?|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_068.wav|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_069.wav|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_070.wav|But I've won both ways.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_071.wav|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_072.wav|Robin Williams is very subdued.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_073.wav|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_074.wav|It could take some time.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_075.wav|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_076.wav|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.|55,,
wav48/p282/p282_077.wav|It is a job creation scheme.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_078.wav|The party is up for it.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_079.wav|People must remain vigilant.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_080.wav|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_081.wav|What has changed?|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_082.wav|I will miss him.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_083.wav|He is in the queue.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_084.wav|I first met him last summer.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_085.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_086.wav|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_087.wav|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_088.wav|They lived for their children.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_089.wav|The city council is a major property owner in the area.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_090.wav|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_091.wav|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_092.wav|We are on the path of change.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_093.wav|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_094.wav|Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_095.wav|Yet, it worked.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_096.wav|He's been hit by it.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_097.wav|I love the Dome.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_098.wav|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_099.wav|However, we have not come to any conclusions.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_100.wav|It is a love affair.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_101.wav|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_102.wav|They make a selective perception process.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_103.wav|Two of the team became ill.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_104.wav|That would be unlawful.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_105.wav|I don't want to use it.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_106.wav|Oil embargo endorsed.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_107.wav|It was an adventure.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_108.wav|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_109.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_110.wav|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_111.wav|I was fighting for my life, I thought.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_112.wav|Is that right?|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_113.wav|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_114.wav|It's a shame.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_115.wav|It was the eighties.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_116.wav|It is so sad.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_117.wav|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_118.wav|The mood is upbeat.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_119.wav|It is rubbish.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_120.wav|Who would be a referee?|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_121.wav|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_122.wav|We enjoyed it today.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_123.wav|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_124.wav|Here, again, they were denied a voice.|55,,
wav48/p282/p282_125.wav|There were no grounds for his action.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_126.wav|I'm so angry.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_127.wav|She really suffered for her art.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_128.wav|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_129.wav|It is not a U-turn.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_130.wav|No production was achieved.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_131.wav|I am now unemployed.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_132.wav|We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_133.wav|It plans to return to this field.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_134.wav|We work well together.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_135.wav|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_136.wav|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_137.wav|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_138.wav|I was dead.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_139.wav|I don't know the full story.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_140.wav|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_141.wav|She died at her home.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_142.wav|He realises his mistake.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_143.wav|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_144.wav|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.|55,,
wav48/p282/p282_145.wav|I was awful.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_146.wav|Who would have?|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_147.wav|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_148.wav|It is not just about pay.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_149.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_150.wav|There was a substantial explosion.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_151.wav|I was stunned.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_152.wav|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_153.wav|The weather forecast isn't good.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_154.wav|They have not been named.|55,,,,

wav48/p282/p282_160.wav|Life becomes a song.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_161.wav|Well, he should know.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_162.wav|Was this element always there?|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_163.wav|These days are long gone.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_164.wav|I'd love to be like Peter.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_165.wav|I've put my own money into this project.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_166.wav|It has to be now.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_167.wav|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_168.wav|I was in the train station overnight.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_169.wav|We have a budget in March.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_170.wav|We should do everything at a stroke.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_171.wav|You had to go and see him.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_172.wav|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_173.wav|In a way he was.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_174.wav|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_175.wav|Blair's response was weak.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_176.wav|As we worked.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_177.wav|We are the gateway to justice.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_178.wav|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_179.wav|The goals were good.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_180.wav|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_181.wav|It's an idea.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_182.wav|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_183.wav|They need to look after themselves.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_184.wav|I saw military vehicles in the distance.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_185.wav|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_186.wav|Does this matter?|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_187.wav|Our team is just so young.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_188.wav|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_189.wav|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_190.wav|It caused a lot of upset.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_191.wav|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_192.wav|We speak about the performance.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_193.wav|It is a farce.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_194.wav|Peace was won.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_195.wav|It's a fact.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_196.wav|I came home by ambulance.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_197.wav|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_198.wav|Is that success?|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_199.wav|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_200.wav|Who will pay for this?|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_201.wav|It's all about money, money, money.|55,,
wav48/p282/p282_202.wav|Sadly, it can't.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_203.wav|It was worth a photograph.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_204.wav|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_205.wav|We have an election in eight days.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_206.wav|Feel the heat?|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_207.wav|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_208.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_209.wav|It had all been arranged.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_210.wav|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_211.wav|Work has started.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_212.wav|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_213.wav|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_214.wav|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_215.wav|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_216.wav|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_217.wav|Then another one came.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_218.wav|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_219.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_220.wav|Clearly, the stakes are high.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_221.wav|It's a question of creating a future awareness.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_222.wav|I'd never seen a play about me.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_223.wav|It's not before time.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_224.wav|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_225.wav|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_226.wav|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_227.wav|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.|55,,
wav48/p282/p282_228.wav|My wife and family are the support system.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_229.wav|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_230.wav|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_231.wav|We are so proud.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_232.wav|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_233.wav|Of course I was tempted.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_234.wav|It's quite a line-up!|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_235.wav|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_236.wav|The minister is the engineer.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_237.wav|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_238.wav|It is hard won.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_239.wav|Our policy is clear.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_240.wav|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_241.wav|The scene is about this?|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_242.wav|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_243.wav|My son was too young to die.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_244.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_245.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.|55,,
wav48/p282/p282_246.wav|It was a hit.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_247.wav|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_248.wav|That could be in place by next year.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_249.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_250.wav|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_251.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_252.wav|they fail to engage.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_253.wav|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_254.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_255.wav|They must play for each other.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_256.wav|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_257.wav|There's not much money in cycling.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_258.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_259.wav|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.|55,,
wav48/p282/p282_260.wav|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_261.wav|He has not created a Festival resource.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_262.wav|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_263.wav|He was also married with two children.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_264.wav|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_265.wav|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_266.wav|Our objective is to tackle poverty.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_267.wav|One knows the feeling.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_268.wav|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.|55,,
wav48/p282/p282_269.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_270.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_271.wav|She failed in her action.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_272.wav|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_273.wav|She looked so young.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_274.wav|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_275.wav|It's so awful.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_276.wav|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_277.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_278.wav|You've got to have both sides.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_279.wav|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_280.wav|Dialogue is the key.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_281.wav|They have shown a great desire and attitude.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_282.wav|She is an expert on medical ethics.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_283.wav|Who will perform?|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_284.wav|This is a national crisis.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_285.wav|Who did the recruiting?|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_286.wav|She is really magic.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_287.wav|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_288.wav|I was the sheep.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_289.wav|I was brought up in a mining background.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_290.wav|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_291.wav|Nothing is safe.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_292.wav|But it's a subtle process.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_293.wav|One was a lawyer.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_294.wav|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_295.wav|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_296.wav|They are wrong.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_297.wav|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_298.wav|There were no passengers on board.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_299.wav|It could work.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_300.wav|This is a war over our home.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_301.wav|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_302.wav|There's no evidence he was ever there.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_303.wav|You should be.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_304.wav|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.|55,,
wav48/p282/p282_305.wav|The letters are going out today.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_306.wav|Is there on his hands?|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_307.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_308.wav|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.|55,,
wav48/p282/p282_309.wav|She is very distinctive.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_310.wav|We have got to get the points from this one.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_311.wav|You may have a short memory.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_312.wav|Henman has been warned.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_313.wav|We are in the end game.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_314.wav|It will work.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_315.wav|I came into this world with nothing.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_316.wav|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_317.wav|Our message was inclusive.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_318.wav|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_319.wav|Feel the air, the space.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_320.wav|Is there a new way forward?|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_321.wav|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.|55,,
wav48/p282/p282_322.wav|The figures are bad, but not that bad.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_323.wav|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_324.wav|However, they will only be found in the wild.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_325.wav|The same things will happen with GM foods.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_326.wav|Three years ago he would have been.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_327.wav|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_328.wav|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.|55,,
wav48/p282/p282_329.wav|Two people were interviewed.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_330.wav|I've got no secret.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_331.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_332.wav|This is a friendly match?|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_333.wav|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_334.wav|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_335.wav|They should take their mobile phones.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_336.wav|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_337.wav|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_338.wav|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_339.wav|She is free.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_340.wav|Both of those promises have already been honoured.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_341.wav|Tyson is overwhelmed.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_342.wav|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_343.wav|Yet he left a few days later.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_344.wav|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_345.wav|As, indeed, they would be.|55,,
wav48/p282/p282_346.wav|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_347.wav|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_348.wav|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_349.wav|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_350.wav|That would help.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_351.wav|My husband was angry.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_352.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_353.wav|And he laughs.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_354.wav|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_355.wav|This is a club on the rise.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_356.wav|It's not pretty, but it's effective.|55,,,
wav48/p282/p282_357.wav|Their time has gone.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_358.wav|He could make it.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_359.wav|The death rates are still as high.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_360.wav|Now, though, he has an incentive.|55,,
wav48/p282/p282_361.wav|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_362.wav|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_363.wav|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_364.wav|It is a simple equation.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_365.wav|By that time, however, it was already too late.|55,,
wav48/p282/p282_366.wav|It was a funny game.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_367.wav|There wasn't a goal.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_368.wav|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_369.wav|Colour was at the core of his life.|55,,,,
wav48/p282/p282_370.wav|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.|55,,
wav48/p283/p283_001.wav|Please call Stella. |56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |56,,
wav48/p283/p283_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |56,,
wav48/p283/p283_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |56,,
wav48/p283/p283_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |56,,
wav48/p283/p283_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|56,,
wav48/p283/p283_025.wav|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_026.wav|We are a service industry.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_027.wav|It's not going to work out that way.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_028.wav|The idea is not new.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_029.wav|Because we do not need it.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_030.wav|And we have a singer.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_031.wav|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_032.wav|We speak about the performance.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_033.wav|It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_034.wav|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_035.wav|It could well be the case.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_036.wav|It is not for any other purpose.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_037.wav|That means an extra two years.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_038.wav|You must always attempt to raise the bar.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_039.wav|He is believed to live in Britain.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_040.wav|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_041.wav|She hopes to study in Britain one day.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_042.wav|The boy is no longer with us.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_043.wav|There's been a wake up call for the sector this week.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_044.wav|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.|56,,
wav48/p283/p283_045.wav|Among them are many criminals.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_046.wav|I was released after six days.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_047.wav|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_048.wav|Every aspect of our play was first class.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_049.wav|No details of the talks were given.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_050.wav|Clearly, they had other problems.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_051.wav|It also opened a branch in Livingston.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_052.wav|I would say the position is open.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_053.wav|That was the theory, anyway.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_054.wav|I had come back from London.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_055.wav|I was inspired by two things.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_056.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.|56,,
wav48/p283/p283_057.wav|There was no safety net.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_058.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_059.wav|How are you, sir ?|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_060.wav|So is that it, then ?|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_061.wav|Do I have a favourite ?|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_062.wav|What do we do ?|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_063.wav|He also presented You Bet!|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_064.wav|Inspiring public confidence is crucial.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_065.wav|I expect a rapid response.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_066.wav|We felt it was sufficient.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_067.wav|This is the year of the Tiger.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_068.wav|The motive for the shooting was not known.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_069.wav|We believe a third party was involved.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_070.wav|The Government should be ashamed.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_071.wav|There's still plenty time left.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_072.wav|You do not change overnight.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_073.wav|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_074.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_075.wav|We will pay their bills.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_076.wav|He is a young man with a new deal.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_077.wav|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_078.wav|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_079.wav|It is very special for me.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_080.wav|The tournament has now been cancelled.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_081.wav|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_082.wav|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_083.wav|The girls are so lucky to be alive.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_084.wav|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_085.wav|The result is a vacuum.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_086.wav|It looks like a hit.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_087.wav|I'd like to see the business case.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_088.wav|It makes for an interesting conference.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_089.wav|I've had it for the exams.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_090.wav|You have to respect the office.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_091.wav|He has been a success this year.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_092.wav|By then, he was walking on water.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_093.wav|We have to offer value for money.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_094.wav|It's so hard to shift.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_095.wav|They lived for their children.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_096.wav|Potions said he would drive.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_097.wav|The trick is to try it.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_098.wav|Little is known about them.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_099.wav|However, it did not end that way.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_100.wav|It really was an unusual award.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_101.wav|IT has been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_102.wav|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_103.wav|We could not get any possession.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_104.wav|That is the important thing.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_105.wav|Why do it otherwise ?|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_106.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_107.wav|So, did she meet him ?|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_108.wav|So what is the campaign about ?|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_109.wav|And does it ?|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_110.wav|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_111.wav|It's good to have a voice.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_112.wav|However, we have not come to any conclusions.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_113.wav|There is a contract in existence for Allan.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_114.wav|Their attitude is all wrong.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_115.wav|We made a world record together.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_116.wav|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_117.wav|It's for that reason he should resign.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_118.wav|There were no grounds for his action.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_119.wav|It's been a long wait.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_120.wav|There is no credible official announcement.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_121.wav|Our house was very small.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_122.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_123.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.|56,,
wav48/p283/p283_124.wav|Our idea is to share and lower the cost.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_125.wav|Sport is good for you.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_126.wav|It was won on the issue of the land.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_127.wav|I am a committed European.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_128.wav|From it emerged a cup.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_129.wav|That was the first step.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_130.wav|That might help a bit.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_131.wav|It is a delight on every level.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_132.wav|We would make a start.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_133.wav|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_134.wav|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_135.wav|They keep the atmosphere in mind.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_136.wav|It does not even have a staff shortage.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_137.wav|This should begin in October.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_138.wav|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_139.wav|We did what we had to do.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_140.wav|If not, a deal could take many months.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_141.wav|But it is different in different regions.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_142.wav|Last night, the row continued.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_143.wav|You've got to be vigilant.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_144.wav|Glasgow is a friendly city.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_145.wav|We are entirely happy with Russell.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_146.wav|It's not a U-turn at all.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_147.wav|And I have some advice for my old friend.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_148.wav|He was a home referee.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_149.wav|Before it was an ordeal.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_150.wav|I'm sure this game will be equally successful.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_151.wav|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_152.wav|I'm so grateful for that.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_153.wav|It will be retained as part of the group.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_154.wav|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_155.wav|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_156.wav|I am just trying to do my job.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_157.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_158.wav|It has become a way of life.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_159.wav|I was caught out a little bit.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_160.wav|This will secure the future of our industry.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_161.wav|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_162.wav|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_163.wav|There's only one team in Ayrshire.|56,,,,

wav48/p283/p283_165.wav|Are you going to win ?|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_166.wav|Was it the wife ?|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_167.wav|Why change it ?|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_168.wav|What do we want to do that for ?|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_169.wav|It has to be an event.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_170.wav|Three hours later, the man was free.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_171.wav|We have a clean bill of health.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_172.wav|It was by the numbers.|56,,,,

wav48/p283/p283_176.wav|He was asked to quit.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_177.wav|There is no reason at all.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_178.wav|The woman was his wife.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_179.wav|This action reflects a slump in bookings.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_180.wav|They should stop the bombing.|56,,,,

wav48/p283/p283_298.wav|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_299.wav|The next month is very important.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_300.wav|I would have the hammer in the crowd.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_301.wav|This is a total mystery.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_302.wav|At first I thought I was gone.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_303.wav|It is the end of an adventure.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_304.wav|It has the potential to be another North Sea.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_305.wav|It looks as though he will be right.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_306.wav|As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_307.wav|It was an easy decision to come here.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_308.wav|The target is to break even by Christmas.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_309.wav|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_310.wav|My whole life has changed.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_311.wav|It was never a free kick.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_312.wav|It further expressed his defiance.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_313.wav|He said he was sorry.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_314.wav|It's called the Supreme Court for a reason.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_315.wav|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_316.wav|We have to be very, very careful.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_317.wav|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_318.wav|If not, he should go home.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_319.wav|He is well respected by his colleagues.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_320.wav|Hopefully, this week will be good.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_321.wav|This is the correct decision.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_322.wav|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_323.wav|The Project is far from that.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_324.wav|What form did that take ?|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_326.wav|What are they for ?|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_327.wav|Is there a waiting list ?|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_328.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_329.wav|So what happens next ?|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_330.wav|He will address the nation this evening.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_331.wav|The attacker died in the crash.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_332.wav|We would hope to make progress on that next year.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_333.wav|No final decision has been taken.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_334.wav|In Europe, it is always over two games.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_335.wav|I was there five months ago.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_336.wav|Well, he can do it.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_337.wav|The songs are just so good.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_338.wav|And it's a goodbye from him.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_339.wav|We need to increase the membership.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_340.wav|A new school will be built.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_341.wav|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_342.wav|The capital costs are modest.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_343.wav|It became a book by itself.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_344.wav|Cast Away now on general release.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_345.wav|Like many companies, it is a problem.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_346.wav|The party lasted all night.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_347.wav|But I think it's different from the rest!|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_348.wav|It is a matter of clarity.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_349.wav|He did that every night I was with him.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_350.wav|They come to enjoy themselves.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_351.wav|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_352.wav|Another reason is a shortage of stock.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_353.wav|And he goes with it.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_354.wav|My life is exactly the same.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_356.wav|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_357.wav|We want to play at the worlds.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_358.wav|We will listen to any suggestion.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_359.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_360.wav|Public opinion was split on the proposal.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_361.wav|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_362.wav|In the old days, it was easy.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_363.wav|They were impressive against France.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_364.wav|The airport was even different.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_365.wav|The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_366.wav|He was at school in Devon.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_367.wav|I'd like to take the plunge.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_368.wav|I have a moral dilemma.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_369.wav|Last weekend he was awful.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_370.wav|There is a range of employers.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_371.wav|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_372.wav|Ferguson is a good example.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_373.wav|But they have taken the lesson to heart.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_374.wav|The Allies intend to maintain the average.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_375.wav|My mind is focused on the next four weeks.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_376.wav|It should be a great game, though.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_377.wav|I said she was very young.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_378.wav|He had no previous convictions.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_379.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_380.wav|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_381.wav|Had this been common practice ?|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_382.wav|What do they want us to do ?|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_383.wav|Is it worth it ?|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_384.wav|Does it matter ?|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_385.wav|That can be good for us.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_386.wav|I believe the gap is nearly there.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_387.wav|But the main issue will be the sale of Burger King.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_388.wav|They were to blame for the first two goals.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_389.wav|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_390.wav|It's as wide as a church in here.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_391.wav|It would be quite nice.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_392.wav|You must have a government and a good civil service.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_393.wav|The pair are very much in love.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_394.wav|As, indeed, they would be.|56,,
wav48/p283/p283_395.wav|He has an equity stake in the investment house.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_396.wav|This is a club on the rise.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_397.wav|We came across the first set of bodies.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_398.wav|Theatre is not a museum.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_399.wav|It has only been rumours.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_400.wav|Final proposals will be published in February.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_401.wav|I could not live with it.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_402.wav|The death rates are still as high.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_403.wav|A review is under way.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_404.wav|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_405.wav|There is a lack of logic.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_406.wav|That investment has now been secured.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_407.wav|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_408.wav|It proved a good decision.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_409.wav|Colour was at the core of his life.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_410.wav|The BBC was a disgrace.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_411.wav|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_412.wav|But the foundations have been laid.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_413.wav|I was Scottish on the basis of my family.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_414.wav|I was shaking on the blocks.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_415.wav|They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_416.wav|I remain a buyer of the shares.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_417.wav|The second goal was superb.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_418.wav|That's all I can say.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_419.wav|How do you take them away ?|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_420.wav|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?|56,,
wav48/p283/p283_421.wav|After the match, do you ?|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_422.wav|I am astonished at attack.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_423.wav|I was pleased with my own game.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_424.wav|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_425.wav|Yet the data is compelling.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_426.wav|No date has been set for a meeting.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_427.wav|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_428.wav|That is a personal matter.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_429.wav|I'm pleased about one thing.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_430.wav|My aim is a top six finish.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_431.wav|These guys are looking for business.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_432.wav|He is on the wrong side.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_433.wav|I would rather look at him.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_434.wav|It needs to be volatile.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_435.wav|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_436.wav|It is based on a true story.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_437.wav|But, in fact, the reverse is true.|56,,
wav48/p283/p283_438.wav|Being with me is an honour.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_439.wav|He will be judged by his actions.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_440.wav|Which may be the same thing.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_441.wav|We know about the crisis in cattle.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_442.wav|We shall not forget him.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_443.wav|I can almost pretend to be Scottish.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_444.wav|Everything in golf is a balance.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_445.wav|THE boy in The Sixth Sense is not alone.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_446.wav|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.|56,,
wav48/p283/p283_447.wav|Something has got to give.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_448.wav|Sentiment was helped by the sharp fall in debt.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_449.wav|If we were offered The Scotsman I would buy it.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_450.wav|We went straight into the bedroom.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_451.wav|I do not see it as some kind of reward.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_452.wav|But we have built a platform for next season.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_453.wav|I was embarrassed by it.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_454.wav|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_455.wav|They had learned from the lessons of the first game.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_456.wav|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.|56,,,
wav48/p283/p283_457.wav|I'd never run for them.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_458.wav|She came to the Highland Show.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_459.wav|He was confronted by police.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_460.wav|I am greatly relieved that the trust has reached its target.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_461.wav|She has reached the top of her profession.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_462.wav|Let that be their memorial.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_463.wav|This morning I got a call from my wife.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_464.wav|She has now been registered as disabled.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_465.wav|The move is considered a major breakthrough.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_466.wav|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_467.wav|It all began as an accident.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_468.wav|We are going through the process.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_469.wav|Ms Jackson was not present to put her case.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_470.wav|City sentiment is in his favour.|56,,,,
wav48/p283/p283_471.wav|It's been a long, long journey.|56,,,
wav48/p284/p284_001.wav|Please call Stella. |57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |57,,
wav48/p284/p284_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |57,,
wav48/p284/p284_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |57,,
wav48/p284/p284_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |57,,
wav48/p284/p284_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.It's nice to hear.|57,,
wav48/p284/p284_025.wav|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_026.wav|We will be homeless.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_027.wav|Is this accurate?|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_028.wav|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_029.wav|They have no history.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_030.wav|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|57,,
wav48/p284/p284_031.wav|I'd just like to play.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_032.wav|There's a story, too.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_033.wav|This is the window.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_034.wav|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_035.wav|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_036.wav|Then, suddenly, they weren't.|57,,
wav48/p284/p284_037.wav|It's a fact.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_038.wav|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_039.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_040.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.|57,,
wav48/p284/p284_041.wav|Dancing was her life.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_042.wav|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_043.wav|We will push.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_044.wav|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_045.wav|Among them are many criminals.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_046.wav|It is marvellous.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_047.wav|Every aspect of our play was first class.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_048.wav|Our people are ready.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_049.wav|Here's a clue.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_050.wav|Her body was found about four miles from the car.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_051.wav|I was inspired by two things.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_052.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.|57,,
wav48/p284/p284_053.wav|My fitness was very poor.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_054.wav|Sadly, it can't.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_055.wav|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_056.wav|I expect a rapid response.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_057.wav|What was the main difference?|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_058.wav|There's a danger.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_059.wav|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_060.wav|Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_061.wav|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_062.wav|It's that kind of place.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_063.wav|They are real.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_064.wav|I've spent a lot of time on buses.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_065.wav|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.|57,,
wav48/p284/p284_066.wav|And if he hadn't become a musician?|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_067.wav|That was a gold medal for certain.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_068.wav|We should have known.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_069.wav|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_070.wav|Robin Williams is very subdued.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_071.wav|He was at home with his pals.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_072.wav|It was magic.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_073.wav|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.|57,,
wav48/p284/p284_074.wav|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_075.wav|Is there a new way forward?|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_076.wav|The party is up for it.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_077.wav|Even the one she loved.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_078.wav|People must remain vigilant.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_079.wav|Today she has been released.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_080.wav|Who will pay for this?|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_081.wav|He had taken everything from me.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_082.wav|He seems to be pleased with the picture.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_083.wav|By then, he was walking on water.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_084.wav|They lived for their children.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_085.wav|The city council is a major property owner in the area.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_086.wav|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_087.wav|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_088.wav|It is a lifeline.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_089.wav|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_090.wav|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_091.wav|She is an expert on medical ethics.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_092.wav|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_093.wav|Then came the crunch.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_094.wav|It is annoying.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_095.wav|I love the Dome.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_096.wav|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_097.wav|I am extremely sad.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_098.wav|It is a love affair.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_099.wav|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_100.wav|May not have been at fault?|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_101.wav|They tried to deny it.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_102.wav|They make a selective perception process.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_103.wav|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_104.wav|That's all right then.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_105.wav|Oil embargo endorsed.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_106.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_107.wav|She reflects a bit.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_108.wav|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_109.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_110.wav|It was a funny game.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_111.wav|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_112.wav|I was fighting for my life, I thought.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_113.wav|It was the eighties.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_114.wav|I did not see any reason to change the captain.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_115.wav|It is so sad.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_116.wav|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_117.wav|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_118.wav|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_119.wav|It is rubbish.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_120.wav|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_121.wav|We enjoyed it today.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_122.wav|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_123.wav|There were no grounds for his action.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_124.wav|I can't even get into the A team.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_125.wav|She really suffered for her art.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_126.wav|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_127.wav|The people will come.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_128.wav|No production was achieved.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_129.wav|She said she would not welcome the flowers.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_130.wav|It plans to return to this field.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_131.wav|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_132.wav|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_133.wav|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_134.wav|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_135.wav|I don't know the full story.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_136.wav|It seems so long since I did the exams.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_137.wav|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_138.wav|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_139.wav|I was awful.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_140.wav|The idea is simple.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_141.wav|That group reported just before Christmas.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_142.wav|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_143.wav|It is not just about pay.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_144.wav|Note the date.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_145.wav|So I got a blood test.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_146.wav|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_147.wav|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_148.wav|The weather forecast isn't good.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_149.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.|57,,
wav48/p284/p284_150.wav|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_151.wav|I was on a roll.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_152.wav|She had gone to the Catholic school.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_153.wav|We are on a four-year mission.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_154.wav|My Dad is a hero.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_155.wav|He was asked to quit.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_156.wav|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_157.wav|He can do no wrong.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_158.wav|Was this element always there?|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_159.wav|These days are long gone.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_160.wav|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_161.wav|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_162.wav|They are not advertised.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_163.wav|Seven people were later detained by police.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_164.wav|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.|57,,
wav48/p284/p284_165.wav|Again, we were lucky.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_166.wav|They will do their own thing.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_167.wav|Does that put pressure on us?|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_168.wav|One season, they might do well.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_169.wav|Is Saddam a threat?|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_170.wav|As we worked.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_171.wav|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_172.wav|It is not either national standards or local control.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_173.wav|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_174.wav|I'm just going to hit the shot.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_175.wav|Everyone can be bought.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_176.wav|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_177.wav|I've been there.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_178.wav|Four policemen were wounded.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_179.wav|I saw military vehicles in the distance.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_180.wav|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_181.wav|What has caused the demise of singing?|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_182.wav|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_183.wav|Our team is just so young.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_184.wav|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_185.wav|It is a farce.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_186.wav|Peace was won.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_187.wav|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.|57,,
wav48/p284/p284_188.wav|I came home by ambulance.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_189.wav|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_190.wav|Is that success?|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_191.wav|They are ready.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_192.wav|I have a cold.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_193.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_194.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.|57,,
wav48/p284/p284_195.wav|It's all about money, money, money.|57,,
wav48/p284/p284_196.wav|There was no safety net.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_197.wav|It was worth a photograph.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_198.wav|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_199.wav|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_200.wav|There was an e-mail.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_201.wav|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_202.wav|I am delighted for Simon.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_203.wav|It had all been arranged.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_204.wav|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_205.wav|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_206.wav|It's not ideal.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_207.wav|In each case they were a goal down.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_208.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_209.wav|I might come back.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_210.wav|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_211.wav|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_212.wav|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_213.wav|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_214.wav|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_215.wav|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_216.wav|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_217.wav|It's a question of creating a future awareness.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_218.wav|It's not before time.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_219.wav|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_220.wav|The report is due out next month.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_221.wav|But she was.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_222.wav|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.|57,,
wav48/p284/p284_223.wav|My wife and family are the support system.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_224.wav|The move was also welcomed by the National Union of Journalists.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_225.wav|We were awful.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_226.wav|They tried to give her advice.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_227.wav|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_228.wav|The parties have been given until today to respond.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_229.wav|There is no excuse.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_230.wav|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_231.wav|But it's a subtle process.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_232.wav|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_233.wav|The car was just there.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_234.wav|The whole thing will be great.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_235.wav|Our policy is clear.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_236.wav|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_237.wav|You can feel at home in China.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_238.wav|The scene is about this?|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_239.wav|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_240.wav|It was a kind of contempt.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_241.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_242.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.|57,,
wav48/p284/p284_243.wav|I should think so, too.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_244.wav|It was a hit.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_245.wav|There's the mix.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_246.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_247.wav|Is there on his hands?|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_248.wav|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.|57,,
wav48/p284/p284_249.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_250.wav|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_251.wav|Chelsea was a great club.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_252.wav|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_253.wav|We have to expand.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_254.wav|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_255.wav|Is that a serious question?|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_256.wav|They must play for each other.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_257.wav|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_258.wav|There's not much money in cycling.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_259.wav|This court has made an order which has not been observed.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_260.wav|I am just trying to do my job.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_261.wav|This is a question of Islam.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_262.wav|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_263.wav|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_264.wav|Frankly, we should all have such problems.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_265.wav|The system can work.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_266.wav|We're in shock.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_267.wav|Our objective is to tackle poverty.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_268.wav|It's a way of life.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_269.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_270.wav|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_271.wav|They seem to get away with it.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_272.wav|She looked so young.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_273.wav|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_274.wav|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_275.wav|If not, he should go home.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_276.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_277.wav|We are a grandmother.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_278.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_279.wav|You feel very helpless.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_280.wav|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.|57,,
wav48/p284/p284_281.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_282.wav|He will address the nation this evening.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_283.wav|They have shown a great desire and attitude.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_284.wav|Maloney is an engaging talent.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_285.wav|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_286.wav|This is a national crisis.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_287.wav|Bombing slaughter rejected|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_288.wav|We are not going to forget.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_289.wav|No Briton has ever won.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_290.wav|Painful, but only because it's true.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_291.wav|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_292.wav|The songs are just so good.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_293.wav|And it's a goodbye from him.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_294.wav|The goals will come.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_295.wav|Who can predict?|57,,,,

wav48/p284/p284_300.wav|What has altered?|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_301.wav|Nothing is safe.|57,,,,

wav48/p284/p284_303.wav|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_304.wav|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_305.wav|They are wrong.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_306.wav|I can live with it.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_307.wav|Work has started.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_308.wav|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_309.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_310.wav|You should be.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_311.wav|The minister is the engineer.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_312.wav|The letters are going out today.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_313.wav|We want to play at the worlds.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_314.wav|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_315.wav|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_316.wav|Special measures were needed.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_317.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_318.wav|The show is at an end.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_319.wav|Your father was a good man.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_320.wav|Such actions are rarely popular.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_321.wav|We have got to get the points from this one.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_322.wav|The election is total confusion and chaos.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_323.wav|Henman has been warned.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_324.wav|I would love it.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_325.wav|Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_326.wav|The problems began a long time ago.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_327.wav|For the moment, our position remains the same.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_328.wav|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_329.wav|We are in the end game.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_330.wav|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_331.wav|There was no time scale.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_332.wav|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_333.wav|It is a job creation scheme.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_334.wav|Relief was beyond belief.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_335.wav|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_336.wav|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_337.wav|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_338.wav|Finally, he paid for the movie.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_339.wav|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_340.wav|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_341.wav|He was the architect.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_342.wav|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.|57,,
wav48/p284/p284_343.wav|He has to learn.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_344.wav|Two people were interviewed.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_345.wav|I've got no secret.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_346.wav|This is a big advantage.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_347.wav|I'm very lucky.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_348.wav|A great deal has been achieved.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_349.wav|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.|57,,
wav48/p284/p284_350.wav|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_351.wav|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_352.wav|They should take their mobile phones.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_353.wav|Eight months later, he was dead.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_354.wav|I HAVE a dream.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_355.wav|We have big ideas.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_356.wav|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_357.wav|I first met him last summer.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_358.wav|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_359.wav|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_360.wav|She is free.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_361.wav|You must have a government and a good civil service.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_362.wav|Yet he left a few days later.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_363.wav|The pair are very much in love.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_364.wav|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_365.wav|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_366.wav|Mentally, you have to be tough.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_367.wav|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_368.wav|There was a substantial explosion.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_369.wav|Their time has gone.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_370.wav|All the investment is possible through the public sector.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_371.wav|They believed it worked.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_372.wav|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_373.wav|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_374.wav|Now, though, he has an incentive.|57,,
wav48/p284/p284_375.wav|They have not done so this season so far.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_376.wav|It is a simple equation.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_377.wav|Clark is back on top form.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_378.wav|There is no signature.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_379.wav|The task is enormous.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_380.wav|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_381.wav|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.|57,,
wav48/p284/p284_382.wav|It is hard to understand.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_383.wav|The Cabinet is split over the issue.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_384.wav|I was lost.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_385.wav|Something is wrong.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_386.wav|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_387.wav|That's the name of the game, though.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_388.wav|It's like a car crash.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_389.wav|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_390.wav|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.|57,,
wav48/p284/p284_391.wav|You had to go and see him.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_392.wav|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_393.wav|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_394.wav|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_395.wav|We try to keep it right.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_396.wav|Stewart will travel with some confidence.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_397.wav|Here, again, they were denied a voice.|57,,
wav48/p284/p284_398.wav|It can help.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_399.wav|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_400.wav|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_401.wav|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_402.wav|But we are a young side.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_403.wav|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_404.wav|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.|57,,
wav48/p284/p284_405.wav|It will take place in July.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_406.wav|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_407.wav|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_408.wav|It is full-scale.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_409.wav|Then , he laughs.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_410.wav|You know the sort of thing.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_411.wav|I knew the script.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_412.wav|It might be.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_413.wav|Feel the air, the space.|57,,,
wav48/p284/p284_414.wav|He scored a touchdown.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_415.wav|I believe the gap is nearly there.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_416.wav|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.|57,,
wav48/p284/p284_417.wav|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_418.wav|It is legally binding.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_419.wav|Is there any prospect of this happening?|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_420.wav|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_421.wav|Eriksson would have approved.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_422.wav|I've invented a village in East Lothian.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_423.wav|It was little else.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_424.wav|He is to appeal.|57,,,,
wav48/p284/p284_425.wav|Nato will prevail.|57,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_001.wav|Please call Stella. |58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |58,,
wav48/p285/p285_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |58,,
wav48/p285/p285_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |58,,
wav48/p285/p285_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |58,,
wav48/p285/p285_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|58,,
wav48/p285/p285_025.wav|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_026.wav|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_027.wav|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_028.wav|However, the following year the cancer returned.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_029.wav|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|58,,
wav48/p285/p285_030.wav|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_031.wav|There's a story, too.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_032.wav|This is the window.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_033.wav|He was jailed for five years.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_034.wav|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_035.wav|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_036.wav|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.|58,,
wav48/p285/p285_037.wav|They're just different.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_038.wav|It was clear.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_039.wav|Indeed, he does.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_040.wav|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_041.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.|58,,
wav48/p285/p285_042.wav|Sure, it's funny.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_043.wav|This represents a tough game for us.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_044.wav|Is a drug dealer?|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_045.wav|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_046.wav|He looks like an Afghan.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_047.wav|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_048.wav|Here's a clue.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_049.wav|I was lost.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_050.wav|It's a miracle.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_051.wav|I love the Dome.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_052.wav|There was no safety net.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_053.wav|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_054.wav|That's the truth.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_055.wav|We will treat it like a World Cup match.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_056.wav|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_057.wav|Scotland had great assets.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_058.wav|It's that kind of place.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_059.wav|They are real.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_060.wav|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_061.wav|We should have known.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_062.wav|I was conceived in Aberdeen.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_063.wav|Robin Williams is very subdued.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_064.wav|The tournament has now been cancelled.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_065.wav|There could be a way back.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_066.wav|The death rates are still as high.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_067.wav|I had my suspicions.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_068.wav|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.|58,,
wav48/p285/p285_069.wav|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_070.wav|Even the one she loved.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_071.wav|It's now down in black and white.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_072.wav|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_073.wav|What has changed?|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_074.wav|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_075.wav|He is in the queue.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_076.wav|He is driven.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_077.wav|All options are open.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_078.wav|I was too young.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_079.wav|Someone who cares|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_080.wav|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_081.wav|It is a blow.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_082.wav|They lived for their children.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_083.wav|It will be tight.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_084.wav|This is the start of our season.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_085.wav|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_086.wav|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_087.wav|We knew they could do it.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_088.wav|But I was wrong.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_089.wav|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_090.wav|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_091.wav|I saw the whole thing.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_092.wav|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_093.wav|It was mayhem.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_094.wav|Journalists should make him.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_095.wav|It is a love affair.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_096.wav|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_097.wav|They tried to deny it.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_098.wav|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_099.wav|No, the equipment is extra.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_100.wav|We have an election in eight days.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_101.wav|Oil embargo endorsed.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_102.wav|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_103.wav|She reflects a bit.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_104.wav|It was an interesting thing to do.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_105.wav|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_106.wav|She is believed to be in South Africa.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_107.wav|I was fighting for my life, I thought.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_108.wav|Is that right?|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_109.wav|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_110.wav|It was the eighties.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_111.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_112.wav|It is so sad.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_113.wav|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_114.wav|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.|58,,,

wav48/p285/p285_117.wav|We enjoyed it today.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_118.wav|She does not want to speak.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_119.wav|Here, again, they were denied a voice.|58,,

wav48/p285/p285_121.wav|It has removed a bit of guilt.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_122.wav|She really suffered for her art.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_123.wav|It is not a U-turn.|58,,,,

wav48/p285/p285_125.wav|No production was achieved.|58,,,,

wav48/p285/p285_127.wav|I am now unemployed.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_128.wav|We work well together.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_129.wav|It's not true.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_130.wav|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.|58,,,,

wav48/p285/p285_156.wav|That includes the equipment?|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_157.wav|Well, he should know.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_158.wav|I will tell you.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_159.wav|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.|58,,,,

wav48/p285/p285_169.wav|I carried on for him.|58,,,,

wav48/p285/p285_171.wav|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_172.wav|One season, they might do well.|58,,,

wav48/p285/p285_191.wav|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_192.wav|It caused a lot of upset.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_193.wav|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_194.wav|It's a fact.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_195.wav|I came home by ambulance.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_196.wav|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.|58,,,,

wav48/p285/p285_201.wav|Today was first class.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_202.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_203.wav|I don't want to use it.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_204.wav|There was an e-mail.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_205.wav|He knows a lot.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_206.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_207.wav|It's not before time.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_208.wav|It's not ideal.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_209.wav|We want to keep the pound.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_210.wav|In each case they were a goal down.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_211.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_212.wav|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_213.wav|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_214.wav|People should make their own decisions.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_215.wav|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_216.wav|Because they didn't want to know.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_217.wav|That has been the easy part.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_218.wav|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_219.wav|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_220.wav|If it doesn't, it doesn't.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_221.wav|I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_222.wav|Clearly, the stakes are high.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_223.wav|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_224.wav|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_225.wav|But she was.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_226.wav|At the time, he was a living legend.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_227.wav|My wife and family are the support system.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_228.wav|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_229.wav|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_230.wav|They tried to give her advice.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_231.wav|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_232.wav|Half of young people had had contact with the police.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_233.wav|Wealth is relative.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_234.wav|You should be.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_235.wav|It's quite nice.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_236.wav|Three weeks later, he resigned.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_237.wav|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_238.wav|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_239.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_240.wav|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_241.wav|If we lose the doctor it would be the last straw.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_242.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_243.wav|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_244.wav|I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_245.wav|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_246.wav|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_247.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.|58,,
wav48/p285/p285_248.wav|It was a hit.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_249.wav|There's the mix.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_250.wav|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_251.wav|The concerns are the same.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_252.wav|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.|58,,
wav48/p285/p285_253.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_254.wav|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_255.wav|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_256.wav|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_257.wav|Is that a serious question?|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_258.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_259.wav|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_260.wav|There's not much money in cycling.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_261.wav|Souter will be back.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_262.wav|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_263.wav|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_264.wav|He was also married with two children.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_265.wav|The system can work.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_266.wav|We are happy.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_267.wav|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_268.wav|We're in shock.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_269.wav|Of course I was tempted.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_270.wav|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_271.wav|It was very fast.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_272.wav|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_273.wav|They seem to get away with it.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_274.wav|I feel pretty good.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_275.wav|The election is total confusion and chaos.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_276.wav|She looked so young.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_277.wav|It's so awful.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_278.wav|He looked very sharp.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_279.wav|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_280.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_281.wav|He will address the nation this evening.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_282.wav|Yet, it worked.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_283.wav|Who will perform?|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_284.wav|It was good.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_285.wav|Who did the recruiting?|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_286.wav|We are not going to forget.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_287.wav|No Briton has ever won.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_288.wav|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_289.wav|Who can predict?|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_290.wav|There was a vacuum.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_291.wav|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_292.wav|He was at home with his pals.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_293.wav|What has altered?|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_294.wav|I was brought up in a mining background.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_295.wav|She is really magic.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_296.wav|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_297.wav|One was a lawyer.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_298.wav|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_299.wav|They are wrong.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_300.wav|It could work.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_301.wav|This is a war over our home.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_302.wav|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_303.wav|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_304.wav|It needs a team approach.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_305.wav|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_306.wav|There is no excuse.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_307.wav|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.|58,,
wav48/p285/p285_308.wav|The letters are going out today.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_309.wav|She is very distinctive.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_310.wav|We are a peaceful people.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_311.wav|Hartley should know.|58,,,,

wav48/p285/p285_315.wav|A review is under way.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_316.wav|It will work.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_317.wav|I came into this world with nothing.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_318.wav|That is a trend which will be encouraged.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_319.wav|Off with their heads.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_320.wav|We think all other measures are not exhausted.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_321.wav|There was no time scale.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_322.wav|Our message was inclusive.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_323.wav|Either team will be hard.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_324.wav|It's not long enough.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_325.wav|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_326.wav|He scored a touchdown.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_327.wav|The party is up for it.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_328.wav|The outcome is not in doubt.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_329.wav|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_330.wav|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_331.wav|The same things will happen with GM foods.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_332.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_333.wav|Three years ago he would have been.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_334.wav|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_335.wav|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.|58,,

wav48/p285/p285_340.wav|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_341.wav|I will miss him.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_342.wav|They should take their mobile phones.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_343.wav|I got a yellow card.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_344.wav|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_345.wav|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_346.wav|I HAVE a dream.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_347.wav|There may be reasons for it.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_348.wav|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_349.wav|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_350.wav|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.|58,,,,

wav48/p285/p285_366.wav|It seems a long time ago.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_367.wav|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_368.wav|So there, we won.|58,,,
wav48/p285/p285_369.wav|By that time, however, it was already too late.|58,,
wav48/p285/p285_370.wav|There is no signature.|58,,,,
wav48/p285/p285_371.wav|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.|58,,,,

wav48/p286/p286_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |59,,,
wav48/p286/p286_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |59,,
wav48/p286/p286_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |59,,
wav48/p286/p286_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |59,,,
wav48/p286/p286_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |59,,,
wav48/p286/p286_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |59,,,
wav48/p286/p286_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |59,,,
wav48/p286/p286_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |59,,
wav48/p286/p286_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|59,,

wav48/p286/p286_133.wav|Structural changes were also required.|59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_134.wav|It was a good game to watch.|59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_135.wav|His job was not advertised.|59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_136.wav|However, the problem is the timing.|59,,,
wav48/p286/p286_137.wav|They keep the atmosphere in mind.|59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_138.wav|Which can happen any time.|59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_139.wav|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.|59,,,,

wav48/p286/p286_428.wav|It was a breathtaking moment.|59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_429.wav|I never had a childhood.|59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_430.wav|Nobody should believe this story.|59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_431.wav|It's going to be epic.|59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_432.wav|They did the right thing.|59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_433.wav|There is another important factor.|59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_434.wav|The growth potential is enormous.|59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_435.wav|THIS is a good day for Scottish farming.|59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_436.wav|But he gave no details.|59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_437.wav|That was a great performance by the team.|59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_438.wav|Which may be the same thing.|59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_439.wav|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.|59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_440.wav|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.|59,,,,

wav48/p286/p286_442.wav|It is never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.|59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_443.wav|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.|59,,
wav48/p286/p286_444.wav|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.|59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_445.wav|There were no formal announcements.|59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_446.wav|He had no problems with discipline.|59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_447.wav|Upgrading the station has been under consideration for some time.|59,,,,

wav48/p286/p286_450.wav|We make this offer to the parliament.|59,,,,

wav48/p286/p286_456.wav|They were good years for him.|59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_457.wav|It was his job to check.|59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_458.wav|The boys are mentally focused.|59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_459.wav|The damage has been done.|59,,,,

wav48/p286/p286_464.wav|Failure to react to each one could mean a disaster.|59,,,,
wav48/p286/p286_465.wav|It is vital to clarify their role.|59,,,,

wav48/p286/p286_468.wav|You have to have a proven track record to get them.|59,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_001.wav|Please call Stella. |60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |60,,
wav48/p287/p287_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |60,,
wav48/p287/p287_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |60,,
wav48/p287/p287_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |60,,
wav48/p287/p287_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|60,,
wav48/p287/p287_025.wav|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_026.wav|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_027.wav|Meetings will also remain private.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_028.wav|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_029.wav|He has the courage of the unaware.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_030.wav|Life was like a timetable.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_031.wav|This is a central issue.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_032.wav|But a solution has been found.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_033.wav|I thought it was an accident.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_034.wav|President Bush is at war.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_035.wav|That period was a struggle.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_036.wav|This represents a tough game for us.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_037.wav|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.|60,,
wav48/p287/p287_038.wav|Among them are many criminals.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_039.wav|But it might have done.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_040.wav|There is no reason at all.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_041.wav|This will get their attention.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_042.wav|Must be prepared to use it.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_043.wav|He will need that machine.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_044.wav|I had come back from London.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_045.wav|I saw them last week.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_046.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.|60,,
wav48/p287/p287_047.wav|There was no safety net.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_048.wav|The teacher would have approved.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_049.wav|It is quite a figure.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_050.wav|We have to look beyond the very short term.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_051.wav|It depends on the couple.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_052.wav|I expect a rapid response.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_053.wav|The motive for the shooting was not known.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_054.wav|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_055.wav|You do not change overnight.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_056.wav|We will pay their bills.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_057.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_058.wav|How are you, sir ?|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_059.wav|So is that it, then ?|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_060.wav|Do I have a favourite ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_061.wav|What do we do ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_062.wav|It has been an amazing day.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_063.wav|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_064.wav|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_065.wav|This is a big step up.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_066.wav|There can be no compromise on welfare.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_067.wav|Both sides have been hit by injury.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_068.wav|Now the plot is perfect.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_069.wav|That would be too easy.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_070.wav|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.|60,,
wav48/p287/p287_071.wav|It looks like a hit.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_072.wav|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_073.wav|I first met him last summer.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_074.wav|We did it for the jersey.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_075.wav|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.|60,,
wav48/p287/p287_076.wav|By then, he was walking on water.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_077.wav|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_078.wav|The cut is excellent news for the consumer.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_079.wav|That was a great performance by the team.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_080.wav|It was a total disaster.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_081.wav|I've never seen anything like it.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_082.wav|He added that he felt undermined.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_083.wav|It was not an insult.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_084.wav|In each case they were a goal down.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_085.wav|It was clear on Thursday.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_086.wav|We would hope to make progress on that next year.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_087.wav|FOR once, you should believe the hype.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_088.wav|But I know the course.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_089.wav|We intend to change the model.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_090.wav|Two of the team became ill.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_091.wav|No, the equipment is extra.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_092.wav|This decision is a farce.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_093.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_094.wav|The cause of the fire is not yet known.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_095.wav|It would be the end of farming.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_096.wav|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_097.wav|It's not a lack of confidence.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_098.wav|We have got a race.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_099.wav|He will go on the bench.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_100.wav|You had better believe it.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_101.wav|New Year will be very busy.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_102.wav|There's still plenty time left.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_103.wav|That was the first step.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_104.wav|I was impressed with them.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_105.wav|Such actions are rarely popular.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_106.wav|Mr Blair should be warned.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_107.wav|Why do it otherwise ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_108.wav|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_109.wav|So, did she meet him ?|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_110.wav|So what is the campaign about ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_111.wav|And does it ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_112.wav|Then again, we could have.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_113.wav|There were no grounds for his action.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_114.wav|We have a training class.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_115.wav|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_116.wav|We did what we had to do.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_117.wav|They made such decisions in London.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_118.wav|She was also very brave.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_119.wav|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_120.wav|You are a gambling man.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_121.wav|My conscience is not clear.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_122.wav|He is a great addition to our team.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_123.wav|I felt he was excellent.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_124.wav|We will try to find someone.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_125.wav|The money needs to go to the front line.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_126.wav|The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_127.wav|I miss the freedom that I had.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_128.wav|But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_129.wav|We had to add value.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_130.wav|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_131.wav|Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_132.wav|That is the real test.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_133.wav|I would relish the prospect.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_134.wav|It has become a way of life.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_135.wav|We will provide immediate access.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_136.wav|It will clearly be discussed in cabinet.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_137.wav|Three hours later, the man was free.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_138.wav|It was deployed in the Gulf War.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_139.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.|60,,
wav48/p287/p287_140.wav|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_141.wav|She had gone to the Catholic school.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_142.wav|It would seem a natural progression.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_143.wav|We will turn the corner.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_144.wav|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.|60,,
wav48/p287/p287_145.wav|This action reflects a slump in bookings.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_146.wav|The strong pound also took its toll.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_147.wav|These days are long gone.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_148.wav|I am a good player.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_149.wav|That shows the strength of the US Tour.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_150.wav|We have a budget in March.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_151.wav|The pension levels will remain the same.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_152.wav|You had to go and see him.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_153.wav|They could not match it.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_154.wav|The people are the hero.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_155.wav|Do not imagine for a moment that they are not there.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_156.wav|The latter can only account for a small proportion of calls.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_157.wav|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_158.wav|This much I can tell you.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_159.wav|The Hibs manager is no fool.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_160.wav|Phase one was a shambles.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_161.wav|The hotel was now for sale.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_162.wav|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_163.wav|Tomorrow is a new day.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_164.wav|What happened in that game ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_165.wav|Are you going to win ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_166.wav|Was it the wife ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_167.wav|Why change it ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_168.wav|What do we want to do that for ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_169.wav|His son is a local legend.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_170.wav|I am not ready to walk away.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_171.wav|Says the Duke of York.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_172.wav|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_173.wav|Our destiny is in our own hands.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_174.wav|They bought the property four years ago.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_175.wav|They need to look after themselves.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_176.wav|He is believed to live in Britain.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_177.wav|People like to talk about these things.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_178.wav|Being investor ready is a good start.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_179.wav|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_180.wav|We've had great things in the past.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_181.wav|It could be done by experts and lawyers.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_182.wav|DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_183.wav|You know the sort of thing.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_184.wav|They were seriously after him.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_185.wav|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_186.wav|It was a pre-emptive strike.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_187.wav|It caused a lot of upset.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_188.wav|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_189.wav|Last night was a key episode.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_190.wav|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_191.wav|It is hard to tell.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_192.wav|I can't play the game for them.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_193.wav|I was inspired by two things.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_194.wav|They might be surprised by the response.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_195.wav|It comes from reflection or thinking.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_196.wav|This will be our new beginning.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_197.wav|The service from the other players was super.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_198.wav|However, it is not as simple as this.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_199.wav|The sanctions are about collective punishment.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_200.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_201.wav|Getting this right is essential.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_202.wav|Does the name matter ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_203.wav|how do you get it back ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_204.wav|What are you not good at ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_205.wav|I think, therefore I am ?|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_206.wav|Who was she ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_207.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_208.wav|From there, they can go anywhere.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_209.wav|I had relied on him.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_210.wav|We used to live with dignity in our country.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_211.wav|This is a sensible and common sense approach.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_212.wav|It had all been arranged.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_213.wav|His third goal was superb.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_214.wav|It's all change at Kilmarnock.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_215.wav|His second was a beauty.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_216.wav|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_217.wav|I wouldn't even respond to that question.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_218.wav|And the World Cup has not even begun.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_219.wav|He remains a main board director of Royal.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_220.wav|The red card was okay.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_221.wav|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_222.wav|Women were mostly notable by their absence.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_223.wav|It will now take over the running of the estate.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_224.wav|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_225.wav|I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_226.wav|Murray Financial has fallen at the first hurdle.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_227.wav|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_228.wav|We have learned a tremendous amount.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_229.wav|She died in middle age.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_230.wav|And thought we would get away with it.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_231.wav|We were a load of rubbish.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_232.wav|The trust was unable to pay the fourth interim dividend.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_233.wav|This is a family club.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_234.wav|They need to win a trophy.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_235.wav|I was ready for this.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_236.wav|I am still waiting for a reply.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_237.wav|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_238.wav|My future is in the marathon.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_239.wav|The effects are not all bad.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_240.wav|He would not impose a fine.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_241.wav|It was a fairy tale.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_242.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_243.wav|She took them for a term.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_244.wav|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_245.wav|But that's another story for another day.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_246.wav|On a practical level, it would be difficult.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_247.wav|Persuaded to change his mind.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_248.wav|Either way, the investor retains the premium.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_249.wav|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_250.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.|60,,
wav48/p287/p287_251.wav|I should think so, too.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_252.wav|It makes no difference to their friendship.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_253.wav|No production contract is yet in sight.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_254.wav|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_255.wav|That you can do it.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_256.wav|He was on a horse.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_257.wav|The concerns are the same.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_258.wav|We are in a war.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_259.wav|It is not enough to be first division champions.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_260.wav|We run within the law.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_261.wav|On the contrary they stand to gain.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_262.wav|They are very keen to work with us.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_263.wav|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_264.wav|It does not work that way in Scottish football.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_265.wav|They must play for each other.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_266.wav|It is also very valuable.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_267.wav|There's not much money in cycling.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_268.wav|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_269.wav|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_270.wav|We're trying to get rounded performers.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_271.wav|This is a question of Islam.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_272.wav|And they were being paid ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_273.wav|was everything done to save people ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_274.wav|What was the matter for concern ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_275.wav|Do I think about them often ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_276.wav|Is it in the right place ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_277.wav|Did he trip ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_278.wav|As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_279.wav|Internet users will double over the next three years in the UK.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_280.wav|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_281.wav|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_282.wav|Frankly, we should all have such problems.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_283.wav|It was an easy decision to come here.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_284.wav|And Michael was just great.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_285.wav|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_286.wav|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_287.wav|He was dead on arrival at hospital.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_288.wav|It was never a free kick.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_289.wav|She failed in her action.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_290.wav|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_291.wav|We have to be very, very careful.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_292.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_293.wav|The partnership was set up during the summer.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_294.wav|If not, he should go home.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_295.wav|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_296.wav|Size is not the issue.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_297.wav|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_298.wav|But it is up again.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_299.wav|The rescue package is public money.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_300.wav|Either team will be hard.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_301.wav|That is the general feeling.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_302.wav|It has to be an event.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_303.wav|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_304.wav|We can work all night.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_305.wav|The answer is with ourselves.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_306.wav|Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott appealed for privacy.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_307.wav|There is no evidence for that.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_308.wav|I can hardly believe it.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_309.wav|Nothing has been put into action.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_310.wav|You are a different people.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_311.wav|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_312.wav|This will secure the future of our industry.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_313.wav|They are not left wing.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_314.wav|McNaughton was not so sure.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_315.wav|I was brought up in a mining background.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_316.wav|The City welcomed the numbers.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_317.wav|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_318.wav|This is a war over our home.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_319.wav|We have a good healthy debate.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_320.wav|And he goes with it.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_321.wav|I have signed a contract.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_322.wav|It is a court case.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_323.wav|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.|60,,
wav48/p287/p287_324.wav|Leading share prices have also fallen in Paris and Frankfurt.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_325.wav|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_326.wav|After some discussion they did.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_327.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_328.wav|It wasn't a good day for us.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_329.wav|The show is at an end.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_330.wav|What form did that take ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_331.wav|Are they free ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_332.wav|What are they for ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_333.wav|Is there a waiting list ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_334.wav|Do they think anyone else wants them ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_335.wav|So what happens next ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_336.wav|It was an achievement all right.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_337.wav|My whole life has changed.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_338.wav|We are a peaceful people.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_339.wav|The election is total confusion and chaos.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_340.wav|You may have a short memory.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_341.wav|The problems began a long time ago.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_342.wav|A Home Office spokesman said.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_343.wav|In the old days, it was easy.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_344.wav|I think it's about time.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_345.wav|The airport was even different.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_346.wav|Other people had looked at it.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_347.wav|They are now out in the cold.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_348.wav|It is not all good news and relief for Labour, however.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_349.wav|It is a strong case.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_350.wav|My view has now completely changed.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_351.wav|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_352.wav|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_353.wav|It's wonderful to have won.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_354.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_355.wav|I'd like to take the plunge.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_356.wav|Appointments should be made on merit.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_357.wav|I have a moral dilemma.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_358.wav|Even the one she loved.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_359.wav|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_360.wav|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_361.wav|They were the acts of men.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_362.wav|This should include procedures for personal imports.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_363.wav|The idea was first mooted a year ago.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_364.wav|Three years ago he would have been.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_365.wav|He did a good job.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_366.wav|It's a policy which has worked for us.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_367.wav|Look at the Liberal Democrats.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_368.wav|He expected a conclusion by next Thursday.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_369.wav|It is a stroke of genius.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_370.wav|The members have voted against it.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_371.wav|We knew he was very creative.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_372.wav|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_373.wav|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_374.wav|They should take their mobile phones.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_375.wav|SE is well down that road.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_376.wav|The hill farm is owned by the father of the young man.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_377.wav|There is a cup final at stake.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_378.wav|It's only a matter of scale.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_379.wav|I do not like to lose.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_380.wav|There is no deal as yet.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_381.wav|It's as wide as a church in here.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_382.wav|This remains the party's policy.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_383.wav|They will fight for everything.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_384.wav|The pair are very much in love.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_385.wav|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_386.wav|It was like a vacuum.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_387.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_388.wav|My dad is all right.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_389.wav|It gets into the culture.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_390.wav|There was a substantial explosion.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_391.wav|But we are very near.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_392.wav|Finally, he paid for the movie.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_393.wav|It has only been rumours.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_394.wav|He put some colour into Scottish history.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_395.wav|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_396.wav|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_397.wav|Safety was also an issue.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_398.wav|Had this been common practice ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_399.wav|What do they want us to do ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_400.wav|Is it worth it ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_401.wav|Does it matter ?|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_402.wav|Motion described it as a unique event.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_403.wav|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_404.wav|No, because it was too many.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_405.wav|It's too close to call.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_406.wav|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_407.wav|I decided to take my time.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_408.wav|FIRST, we had the Battle of Britain.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_409.wav|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_410.wav|That is the ultimate revenge.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_411.wav|It certainly appeared that way.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_412.wav|They are looking for profit.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_413.wav|I remain a buyer of the shares.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_414.wav|YOU thought it was a headache.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_415.wav|I am astonished at attack.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_416.wav|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_417.wav|There is a solution, she believes.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_418.wav|Potions said he would drive.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_419.wav|It was important to win the singles.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_420.wav|I'm pleased about one thing.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_421.wav|That's been all around Europe with me.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_422.wav|He's had to suffer for the last six years.|60,,,,
wav48/p287/p287_423.wav|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.|60,,,
wav48/p287/p287_424.wav|Both promotions come as no surprise.|60,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_001.wav|Please call Stella. |61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store. |61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. |61,,
wav48/p288/p288_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. |61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. |61,,,
wav48/p288/p288_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. |61,,,
wav48/p288/p288_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. |61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. |61,,
wav48/p288/p288_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. |61,,
wav48/p288/p288_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it. |61,,,
wav48/p288/p288_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. |61,,,
wav48/p288/p288_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. |61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. |61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. |61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. |61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. |61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. |61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. |61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. |61,,,
wav48/p288/p288_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. |61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. |61,,,
wav48/p288/p288_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. |61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. |61,,
wav48/p288/p288_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|61,,

wav48/p288/p288_026.wav|It is a disaster area.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_027.wav|Is this accurate?|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_028.wav|However, the following year the cancer returned.|61,,,
wav48/p288/p288_029.wav|Because we do not need it.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_030.wav|I was an athlete.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_031.wav|It is a case of taking a risk.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_032.wav|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_033.wav|I think a move would create a lot of interest.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_034.wav|It was fit for royalty.|61,,,,

wav48/p288/p288_039.wav|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_040.wav|But it took a lot of bottle.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_041.wav|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_042.wav|We need to chat.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_043.wav|But it might have done.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_044.wav|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.|61,,,
wav48/p288/p288_045.wav|He is too weak to move.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_046.wav|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_047.wav|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_048.wav|It will come all right.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_049.wav|I was lost.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_050.wav|I guess I was lucky, though.|61,,,
wav48/p288/p288_051.wav|I was inspired by two things.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_052.wav|Sadly, it can't.|61,,,
wav48/p288/p288_053.wav|It's very odd.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_054.wav|It is unique.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_055.wav|It will take time.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_056.wav|That's the truth.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_057.wav|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_058.wav|The problems are a result of that shortfall.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_059.wav|Four other charges were dropped.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_060.wav|Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.|61,,,,

wav48/p288/p288_065.wav|The end result is precisely the same.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_066.wav|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_067.wav|There is an element of racism in Scotland.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_068.wav|That was the easy election.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_069.wav|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.|61,,,
wav48/p288/p288_070.wav|Neither it is.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_071.wav|He seemed to lose his focus.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_072.wav|It can be halted.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_073.wav|It was chaotic.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_074.wav|Is there a new way forward?|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_075.wav|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_076.wav|I've not thought about it.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_077.wav|People must remain vigilant.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_078.wav|This is the way things should be handled.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_079.wav|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_080.wav|It's all going to clear the debt.|61,,,,

wav48/p288/p288_088.wav|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_089.wav|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.|61,,,
wav48/p288/p288_090.wav|It is a lifeline.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_091.wav|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_092.wav|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.|61,,,,

wav48/p288/p288_097.wav|Here, again, they were denied a voice.|61,,
wav48/p288/p288_098.wav|I didn't play well last year.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_099.wav|It was an adventure.|61,,,,

wav48/p288/p288_105.wav|We do not expect any surplus.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_106.wav|It is so sad.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_107.wav|They were behind the wheel.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_108.wav|The fire was above the hole.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_109.wav|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_110.wav|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.|61,,,
wav48/p288/p288_111.wav|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_112.wav|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.|61,,,
wav48/p288/p288_113.wav|It is rubbish.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_114.wav|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_115.wav|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_116.wav|That's all right then.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_117.wav|There were no grounds for his action.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_118.wav|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_119.wav|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_120.wav|I'm so angry.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_121.wav|It has removed a bit of guilt.|61,,,,

wav48/p288/p288_126.wav|You've got to be vigilant.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_127.wav|The goals were good.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_128.wav|We never said that we would walk through the third division.|61,,,,

wav48/p288/p288_139.wav|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_140.wav|The selection process is still at a very early stage.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_141.wav|The weather forecast isn't good.|61,,,,

wav48/p288/p288_147.wav|They were later discharged from hospital.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_148.wav|This latter point is hugely important.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_149.wav|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.|61,,,
wav48/p288/p288_150.wav|It was so new, so exciting.|61,,,
wav48/p288/p288_151.wav|I'm just enjoying every match.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_152.wav|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_153.wav|It has to be now.|61,,,,

wav48/p288/p288_159.wav|They will do their own thing.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_160.wav|Does that put pressure on us?|61,,,,

wav48/p288/p288_162.wav|It is too much for me.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_163.wav|It is a terrible place.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_164.wav|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_165.wav|Nobody did in those days.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_166.wav|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.|61,,,,

wav48/p288/p288_182.wav|It is tough, but possible.|61,,,
wav48/p288/p288_183.wav|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_184.wav|People will ask about us.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_185.wav|If the director is with you.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_186.wav|It's very difficult to find a buyer.|61,,,,

wav48/p288/p288_193.wav|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.|61,,,
wav48/p288/p288_194.wav|The conference is the first test.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_195.wav|Is that success?|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_196.wav|But we are not immune to the problem.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_197.wav|They are in the euro.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_198.wav|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.|61,,,

wav48/p288/p288_200.wav|It's all about money, money, money.|61,,
wav48/p288/p288_201.wav|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.|61,,,
wav48/p288/p288_202.wav|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.|61,,,
wav48/p288/p288_203.wav|Now, it's all right.|61,,,
wav48/p288/p288_204.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.|61,,,,

wav48/p288/p288_211.wav|In each case they were a goal down.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_212.wav|I was so nervous.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_213.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.|61,,,

wav48/p288/p288_222.wav|But it will be sorted out this week.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_223.wav|It was good fun.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_224.wav|It's a question of creating a future awareness.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_225.wav|I'd never seen a play about me.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_226.wav|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.|61,,,,

wav48/p288/p288_236.wav|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.|61,,,
wav48/p288/p288_237.wav|We have a free vote on these things in our party.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_238.wav|He's got to go.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_239.wav|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_240.wav|It's too much work.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_241.wav|It would appear that it has not been a problem.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_242.wav|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.|61,,,,

wav48/p288/p288_358.wav|We have to move forward.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_359.wav|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_360.wav|However, it was well worth the wait.|61,,,
wav48/p288/p288_361.wav|Our numbers are small.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_362.wav|That would help.|61,,,,

wav48/p288/p288_386.wav|There is a solution, she believes.|61,,,
wav48/p288/p288_387.wav|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.|61,,,
wav48/p288/p288_388.wav|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.|61,,,
wav48/p288/p288_389.wav|It's just outrageous.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_390.wav|It's like a basketball.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_391.wav|Stewart will travel with some confidence.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_392.wav|He is on the wrong side.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_393.wav|It is not normal practice.|61,,,,

wav48/p288/p288_399.wav|He's already made history.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_400.wav|Then , he laughs.|61,,,
wav48/p288/p288_401.wav|You ask the question.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_402.wav|That is not in the interests of anyone or any party.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_403.wav|What would be the point?|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_404.wav|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.|61,,,
wav48/p288/p288_405.wav|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_406.wav|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.|61,,,,
wav48/p288/p288_407.wav|The real enemy is in your own back yard.|61,,,,

wav48/p292/p292_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|62,,
wav48/p292/p292_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|62,,
wav48/p292/p292_025.wav|I was not involved in these discussions.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_026.wav|O, Is he conscious?|62,,,

wav48/p292/p292_032.wav|I don't expect to be here tomorrow.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_033.wav|Or it's not really for us, if you like.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_034.wav|It was a deceit.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_035.wav|You are in power.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_036.wav|PR will be just one of them.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_037.wav|Everything is obviously in the very early stages.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_038.wav|It is just like the stock market.|62,,,,

wav48/p292/p292_043.wav|Mr Blair should be warned.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_044.wav|The idea has potential for the future.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_045.wav|I did not concentrate on my performance.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_046.wav|That was not due to me.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_047.wav|Structural changes were also required.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_048.wav|We suffered a lot for seven years.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_049.wav|The racist abuse was terrible.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_050.wav|What is the new religion?|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_051.wav|Five officers were injured.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_052.wav|It was all for good reason as well.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_053.wav|Fewer people are being killed in accidents.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_054.wav|I'm trying not to think about that.|62,,,,

wav48/p292/p292_056.wav|I find the whole affair disturbing.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_057.wav|One woman refused to sit down.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_058.wav|We're in a state of shock and disbelief.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_059.wav|I was completely knackered.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_060.wav|There are two interests in this woodland.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_061.wav|A killer is also on the loose.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_062.wav|Last night, the row continued.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_063.wav|Our approach will be different.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_064.wav|You can see how he made his money.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_065.wav|It's really good, as long as we play well.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_066.wav|We would certainly consider the proposals.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_067.wav|We tend to come good at the end.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_068.wav|His record with England was not good.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_069.wav|Lose, and they would be ridiculed.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_070.wav|Three penalties were given.|62,,,,

wav48/p292/p292_073.wav|We are just being flooded.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_074.wav|We could easily have lost that game.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_075.wav|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_076.wav|There were no proposals on the table.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_077.wav|It is true, but it is only part of the issue.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_078.wav|THERE's only one word for it.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_079.wav|It was very full anyway.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_080.wav|That was him under pressure.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_081.wav|I can't believe she is dead.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_082.wav|I was in prison for a year.|62,,,,

wav48/p292/p292_089.wav|But he just carried on anyway.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_090.wav|We should be capable of managing it, though.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_091.wav|It was that kind of afternoon.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_092.wav|His presence was very important.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_093.wav|We are pursuing legal action against the government.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_094.wav|He insisted that his staff were too.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_095.wav|They should come clean.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_096.wav|Let's see that increase over the years.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_097.wav|That, though, is an old story.|62,,
wav48/p292/p292_098.wav|The real issue is personal.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_099.wav|Life becomes a song.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_100.wav|It's about time something was done about equipment.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_101.wav|I've learned from my mistakes.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_102.wav|So far this season this approach is working.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_103.wav|I have got a knife.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_104.wav|It was, for me, like a week in heaven.|62,,
wav48/p292/p292_105.wav|What did we learn?|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_106.wav|On that basis, he would set it aside.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_107.wav|That, however, is the end of the good news.|62,,
wav48/p292/p292_108.wav|Seven people were later detained by police.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_109.wav|It's nice to be involved.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_110.wav|There could still be some to come forward.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_111.wav|What are they like?|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_112.wav|They were back in favour with the SAC.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_113.wav|The squad is too small.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_114.wav|Together they will attempt to express the whole.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_115.wav|I'm just going to do my best.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_116.wav|At the moment, the success in Germany is good.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_117.wav|They offered to make an investment into it.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_118.wav|We have no knowledge of this.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_119.wav|I was influenced by all of these things.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_120.wav|Is my wife a racist?|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_121.wav|This would not be my first choice.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_122.wav|It certainly should not be used too often.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_123.wav|They will run a mile.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_124.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_125.wav|Britain has never had it so good.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_126.wav|We are under no illusions about this.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_127.wav|But the killer remains at large.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_128.wav|Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_129.wav|He is adamant that he is innocent.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_130.wav|I had a train to catch.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_131.wav|It is a terrible loss.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_132.wav|What's happening to her?|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_133.wav|It was even worse than at home.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_134.wav|I did not understand the dynamics of Scotland.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_135.wav|The plane was in flames|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_136.wav|We cannot lose it.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_137.wav|I still think he will win.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_138.wav|Elections would follow in about two years.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_139.wav|However, this idea is never developed.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_140.wav|I've got to get on with my career.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_141.wav|It is a road of death.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_142.wav|Now we look forward to it.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_143.wav|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_144.wav|We've had an enjoyable adventure.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_145.wav|I have a great respect for her.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_146.wav|I suggest a new plan.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_147.wav|IT takes the biscuit.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_148.wav|But we are not immune to the problem.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_149.wav|You're not going to forget something like that.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_150.wav|They missed the boat and everyone suffers.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_151.wav|The result is utterly compelling.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_152.wav|This is the root of their problems.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_153.wav|Other forces were, however, at work.|62,,
wav48/p292/p292_154.wav|He also has property interests in the country.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_155.wav|That takes time and games and practice.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_156.wav|If only the acting profession was that simple.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_157.wav|It is a new company for Scotland.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_158.wav|We should have gone solo.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_159.wav|We don't even know his name.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_160.wav|They have known the hard times.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_161.wav|It is about the script for me.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_162.wav|You cannot enter the clubhouse.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_163.wav|The president will not be removed from office.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_164.wav|These are serious matters.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_165.wav|Are you all right at the front?|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_166.wav|We want to replicate that success.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_167.wav|It was the first time they met.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_168.wav|It's been a good year.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_169.wav|I was never alone with her, right?|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_170.wav|That will be vital.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_171.wav|It's a technical demand.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_172.wav|It's just a normal life.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_173.wav|I cannot speak on behalf of the IRA.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_174.wav|This is a very high price.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_175.wav|He is the example for all of us.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_176.wav|There is no way to do this.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_177.wav|Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_178.wav|Only one person can claim the credit.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_179.wav|Market research indicates that this is not feasible.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_180.wav|O Neill has delivered.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_181.wav|But there was no going back.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_182.wav|We will reform the welfare state.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_183.wav|Progress is being made but it is slow.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_184.wav|We didn't think anything would happen.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_185.wav|He had come of age.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_186.wav|We were a shambles at the back.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_187.wav|It's not before time.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_188.wav|One of these problems is the railways.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_189.wav|It is a very sad day.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_190.wav|A crucial moment has arrived.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_191.wav|I have nothing to hide.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_192.wav|Next time round, it will be different.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_193.wav|How can they get one?|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_194.wav|Only local people are helping.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_195.wav|We had to work hard for it.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_196.wav|John Lennon is a very large industry.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_197.wav|This is my homeland.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_198.wav|You saw the pain he was in.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_199.wav|Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_200.wav|Drugs are always an issue.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_201.wav|Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_202.wav|Three weeks later, he resigned.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_203.wav|It has affected me.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_204.wav|She made no further comment.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_205.wav|I have no conflict with them.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_206.wav|The next one comes up.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_207.wav|She was close to suicide at one stage.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_208.wav|We've got better players here.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_209.wav|There is a handful of rewarding paintings.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_210.wav|We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_211.wav|People have no chance of getting out.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_212.wav|I am appalled by this news.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_213.wav|We were extremely arrogant.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_214.wav|Obviously, we would want to look at this.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_215.wav|I was just getting over the time difference.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_216.wav|I am proud of moments like that.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_217.wav|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_218.wav|No-one expected that their parents would stay.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_219.wav|We're looking for unity in the council.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_220.wav|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_221.wav|You cannot allow it to go on.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_222.wav|It's up to the defence team.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_223.wav|I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_224.wav|No means testing will be required.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_225.wav|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_226.wav|I don't think that's very fair.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_227.wav|He was on a horse.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_228.wav|Human beings are always the same.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_229.wav|Then there's the problem of sympathy.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_230.wav|If only he knew himself.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_231.wav|This action could have been avoided.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_232.wav|I watched a game.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_233.wav|Anyone else can apply.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_234.wav|It was like the old days.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_235.wav|This was never a support group.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_236.wav|The first time you read a play.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_237.wav|I was a little surprised.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_238.wav|This is my home town.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_239.wav|That was six years ago.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_240.wav|Nothing can bring back their son.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_241.wav|It is up to us to approve it.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_242.wav|His musicals were very much of their time.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_243.wav|They might well be right.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_244.wav|There is great demand for human cloning.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_245.wav|The balance isn't there at EMI.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_246.wav|It starts to get you down.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_247.wav|We didn't play well and will certainly improve.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_248.wav|My life has been turned upside down.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_249.wav|The years of campaigning have been very difficult.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_250.wav|I have played well the past two days.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_251.wav|I said, What was that about?|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_252.wav|This could prove a problem.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_253.wav|He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_254.wav|His game was complete.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_255.wav|What does she consider her greatest achievement?|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_256.wav|This is too much like Scotland.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_257.wav|He's been here on numerous occasions.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_258.wav|That goes back a long way.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_259.wav|I wouldn't have had the abandon.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_260.wav|They were not at the property yesterday.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_261.wav|We will not tolerate it.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_262.wav|It should not make the same mistake again.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_263.wav|They loved it and it showed.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_264.wav|However, by then the damage had been done.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_265.wav|As far as Scotland is concerned, he should relax.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_266.wav|Have we not been here before?|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_267.wav|Just what we didn't need.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_268.wav|Inquiries are still in an early stage.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_269.wav|It is a very beautiful city.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_270.wav|She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_271.wav|The company reacted very, very well.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_272.wav|Her body was found on Monday morning.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_273.wav|The issues are very intense.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_274.wav|It won't be their last.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_275.wav|You've got to have both sides.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_276.wav|I'll tell you honestly.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_277.wav|Dialogue is the key.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_278.wav|It has been only average.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_279.wav|He should be worried about me.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_280.wav|That never happens in real life.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_281.wav|I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_282.wav|That was the gimmick.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_283.wav|This is a national crisis.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_284.wav|He has changed my life forever.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_285.wav|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_286.wav|In Europe, it is always over two games.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_287.wav|There's a tremendous amount of adventure.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_288.wav|However, we had no failures in our side.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_289.wav|This is his first movie.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_290.wav|He already had had complaints.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_291.wav|For that much we must be grateful.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_292.wav|Spent three months alone at sea.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_293.wav|They are the heroes.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_294.wav|That will be the key to success.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_295.wav|They are in good spirits.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_296.wav|Three hours later, the man was free.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_297.wav|You can't get the experience in Austria.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_298.wav|I wonder if Rangers do that?|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_299.wav|I'm going to miss it.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_300.wav|The atmosphere was excellent.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_301.wav|However, the snow was welcomed by some.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_302.wav|As to rugby, well, no-one knows.|62,,
wav48/p292/p292_303.wav|One was a lawyer.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_304.wav|Our task is to complete the picture.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_305.wav|It may have been a cry for help.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_306.wav|His descent was pathetic.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_307.wav|By now he was very ill with cancer.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_308.wav|But let's not get carried away.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_309.wav|It's only tackling congestion.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_310.wav|Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_311.wav|We've seen that time and time again.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_312.wav|Friends of the family have given their support.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_313.wav|This means a great deal to the families.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_314.wav|They said that they stood by their statement.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_315.wav|It should be equal.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_316.wav|We are on a four-year mission.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_317.wav|He was always nice to me.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_318.wav|Is he going to look after them?|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_319.wav|He had no answer.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_320.wav|Scotland is too small a country for that.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_321.wav|Special measures were needed.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_322.wav|Your father was a good man.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_323.wav|You do that because you want to win.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_324.wav|The whole family was in shock.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_325.wav|This is the last chance, and everyone knows it.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_326.wav|My whole life has changed.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_327.wav|They always seem to produce.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_328.wav|He wanted someone young and ambitious.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_329.wav|But everywhere the problems are the same.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_330.wav|It does affect the staff and the prisoners.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_331.wav|The company's in good shape.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_332.wav|He became the focus of surrounding interest.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_333.wav|It is out there.|62,,,,

wav48/p292/p292_335.wav|The best option is to destroy the plants.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_336.wav|I've never had problems with any football managers.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_337.wav|To begin with it looks good.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_338.wav|They are with their father.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_339.wav|This was a unique election.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_340.wav|The review has been conducted fairly.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_341.wav|They will run in tandem with New Work.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_342.wav|I had to win this race.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_343.wav|And right now, it isn't there.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_344.wav|The boat was fantastic.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_345.wav|Donald was his friend.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_346.wav|The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_347.wav|The girls are ready to compete.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_348.wav|It gives us something to work on.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_349.wav|It was all too little, too late.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_350.wav|What's the problem with change?|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_351.wav|Our destiny is in our own hands.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_352.wav|There are moments of silence.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_353.wav|Glasgow is about to enter a new era.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_354.wav|The board of governors must act.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_355.wav|That didn't happen for two reasons.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_356.wav|It is time for a new approach.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_357.wav|Now they have decided to have a rethink.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_358.wav|Tiger is the exception.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_359.wav|There's no choice is there?|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_360.wav|Does it, Noel?|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_361.wav|Do not forget about Monaco.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_362.wav|You can't give in to the vandals.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_363.wav|Glasgow is far from overload.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_364.wav|Everything was an effort.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_365.wav|And does it even matter?|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_366.wav|My parents are exhausted.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_367.wav|Like his acting, it was an accident.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_368.wav|That's why he is a national treasure.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_369.wav|I'm delighted for Andy.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_370.wav|And how he kept his word.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_371.wav|It's their duty to protect them.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_372.wav|The Cup has come home.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_373.wav|This is a big, big win.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_374.wav|As two candidates are proposed, a vote is taken.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_375.wav|That's an equally important factor.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_376.wav|We were given a break.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_377.wav|It is a hard act to follow, the Winning act.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_378.wav|That would have killed the match.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_379.wav|That's not like us at all.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_380.wav|Scottish teams have got to take their chances.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_381.wav|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_382.wav|You have to rely on each other.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_383.wav|Politics is a tough game.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_384.wav|This season has been a nightmare.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_385.wav|Everyone could see the joke.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_386.wav|He is just a wonderful actor.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_387.wav|Billy knew he was attracted to women.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_388.wav|The occasion was a conference on Scottish art.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_389.wav|Such cases are on the increase.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_390.wav|This was not helpful.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_391.wav|The police are not the target.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_392.wav|It's a true story.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_393.wav|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_394.wav|But that title is a mistake.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_395.wav|It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_396.wav|I'd rather have been playing.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_397.wav|I am immensely sad.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_398.wav|Several others were absent.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_399.wav|It is surprising to come back this way.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_400.wav|Life is about people, and how you feel about people.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_401.wav|Could they perhaps be related?|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_402.wav|We all thought we were going to die.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_403.wav|I knew she was going to win.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_404.wav|What is the Barnett formula?|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_405.wav|Clark is back on top form.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_406.wav|A suspicion was not enough.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_407.wav|It will probably be my last, too.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_408.wav|I'm surprised to hear it from Tony.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_409.wav|It is good for Europe.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_410.wav|I am looking forward to this film.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_411.wav|Colour was at the core of his life.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_412.wav|They would not tell us.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_413.wav|The balance is all wrong in this country.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_414.wav|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_415.wav|It is my decision and my decision alone.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_416.wav|A venue was found.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_417.wav|I will always remember the horrible images.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_418.wav|It can happen to you, it can happen to anyone.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_419.wav|But a surprise is in store.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_420.wav|You can cope with it.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_421.wav|He was back to square one.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_422.wav|We didn't get any from his face.|62,,,,
wav48/p292/p292_423.wav|But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.|62,,,
wav48/p292/p292_424.wav|It's time for a change.|62,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_001.wav|Please call Stella.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|63,,
wav48/p293/p293_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|63,,
wav48/p293/p293_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|63,,
wav48/p293/p293_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|63,,
wav48/p293/p293_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|63,,
wav48/p293/p293_025.wav|It's not, of course, a concert hall.|63,,
wav48/p293/p293_026.wav|Theatre is not a museum.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_027.wav|It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_028.wav|All my training is for Athens.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_029.wav|Subs not used, McCulloch.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_030.wav|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_032.wav|We are satisfied with this outcome.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_033.wav|Several others were absent.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_034.wav|I asked for a picture and she said, No problem.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_035.wav|There is a lot of heroin about.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_036.wav|There is a growing anger among the group.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_037.wav|I have got to adopt the same approach.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_038.wav|Seven people were later detained by police.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_039.wav|It's a sensible management decision.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_040.wav|Just watch the videos and you'll see it.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_041.wav|I would just like someone to confess.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_042.wav|Sub Not Used, McCormick.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_043.wav|We can be proud of our achievements.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_044.wav|Clark is back on top form.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_045.wav|He denied that he was an absentee landlord.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_046.wav|Lothian and Borders Police are also involved.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_047.wav|That was the theory, anyway.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_048.wav|Ferguson must take the blame.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_049.wav|This is thought to mean sometime next week.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_050.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_051.wav|Stealing from the benefits system is no different.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_052.wav|It is a large number.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_053.wav|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_054.wav|General, You didn't get a modified.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_055.wav|It does not even have a staff shortage.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_056.wav|That is our unfinished business.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_057.wav|This is far too high.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_058.wav|The Cabinet is split over the issue.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_059.wav|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_060.wav|But the foundations have been laid.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_061.wav|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_062.wav|So they will settle again.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_063.wav|He had other things on his mind.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_064.wav|Why did it take a concerted campaign?|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_065.wav|Let us hope so.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_066.wav|It can happen to you, it can happen to anyone.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_067.wav|A lot of people had to wait, and people still do.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_068.wav|It felt like my support system was leaving.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_069.wav|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_070.wav|I was shaking on the blocks.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_071.wav|So the challenge is against ourselves.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_072.wav|You see, my back has gone.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_073.wav|It has been a lovely family occasion.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_074.wav|We've had our problems at the club.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_075.wav|His behaviour today has been disgusting.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_076.wav|More than half of the school collapsed.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_077.wav|We also hope to meet the men.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_078.wav|I can live with just the one.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_079.wav|All the people thought that we would die.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_080.wav|Sometimes they come off.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_081.wav|A teacher is, really, about unity.|63,,
wav48/p293/p293_082.wav|Our nation has been changed by this event.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_083.wav|However, my position remains the same.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_084.wav|However, it's good to turn the page.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_085.wav|There are plenty examples.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_086.wav|Self control is just one instalment.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_087.wav|It's an hour of the same response.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_088.wav|I could not believe what they were saying.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_089.wav|A hard act to follow, but it is being followed.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_090.wav|Will he be given time?|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_091.wav|Beyond that would have been outrageous.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_092.wav|I seem to keep this for the majors.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_093.wav|The lowest increase was recorded in Dundee.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_094.wav|We've been overwhelmed by the response.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_095.wav|Her presence was almost everywhere.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_096.wav|But the cost to his health was enormous.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_097.wav|It has been hijacked.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_098.wav|And he's the first to see that, and say that.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_099.wav|They must put them back.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_100.wav|You do have a way out.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_101.wav|Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_102.wav|This is not a European Army.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_103.wav|These guys are looking for business.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_104.wav|And, also, when he does not have the ball.|63,,
wav48/p293/p293_105.wav|I have also been delighted with Stevie.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_106.wav|It was different in the endurance events.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_107.wav|They will now have to justify their position.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_108.wav|It didn't help him, as far as we had seen.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_109.wav|The objective was achieved.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_110.wav|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.|63,,
wav48/p293/p293_111.wav|Look at his last couple of records.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_112.wav|There is no musical background in his family.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_113.wav|The cost of war is more than that.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_114.wav|You, the British people, are the boss.|63,,
wav48/p293/p293_115.wav|The door is open.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_116.wav|PR for Westminster is their holy grail.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_117.wav|She doesn't know me, know anything about me.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_118.wav|These are long-term investments.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_119.wav|Their conditions are described as serious but stable.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_120.wav|He also wants to play in this game, and that's important.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_121.wav|This is excellent news for Glasgow.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_122.wav|If that is the perception, that has to be addressed.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_123.wav|Eriksson would have approved.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_124.wav|You ask the question.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_125.wav|Next league matches, Motherwell Dunfermline.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_126.wav|Eriksson, though, was having none of it.|63,,
wav48/p293/p293_127.wav|The Taliban response was swift.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_128.wav|Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_129.wav|In fact, they should have scored three times.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_130.wav|They have their own interests and techniques.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_131.wav|Well, it was part of our ongoing discussions.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_132.wav|The firm was down and almost out.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_133.wav|Reviving the Scottish Open is one option.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_134.wav|Fifteen minutes later, they were found.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_135.wav|It was very, very difficult for me to look at this.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_136.wav|That is why we are here.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_137.wav|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_138.wav|Somehow they got out.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_139.wav|The house was so well alight.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_140.wav|I've been very nervous.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_141.wav|Ireland is also prepared to take in refugees.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_142.wav|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_143.wav|The proposals were never taken seriously.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_144.wav|The Treasury denied the claims.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_145.wav|The same goes for McKenna.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_146.wav|Perhaps it should stay there.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_147.wav|You can be sure we will have problems.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_148.wav|Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_149.wav|We had to take action to protect them.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_150.wav|We have no idea what caused the derailment.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_151.wav|Our policy is clear.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_152.wav|I think we have a very strong case.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_153.wav|Who would be out there, singing?|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_154.wav|It is very simple, no-one is forced to compete.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_155.wav|However, his remarks were heavily qualified.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_156.wav|It's something he has worked very hard on.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_157.wav|Horses have some sense.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_158.wav|Last night, the extent of the damage was emerging.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_159.wav|Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_160.wav|The only answer is a public inquiry.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_161.wav|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_162.wav|However, the great thing is that it doesn't matter.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_163.wav|Politics is a tough game.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_164.wav|Darrell was, however, adamant.|63,,
wav48/p293/p293_165.wav|The rear of the plane was on fire.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_166.wav|It is physical but it is also good.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_167.wav|It's unfair on her.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_168.wav|So, easy does it.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_169.wav|I just want to enjoy myself.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_170.wav|We are concerned that things should be safe.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_171.wav|At this point we can only speculate.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_172.wav|Family members are at her bedside.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_173.wav|I am very shocked.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_174.wav|The people here are quite reserved.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_175.wav|When will this change?|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_176.wav|It has made me feel good.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_177.wav|It's been such a long haul.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_178.wav|This gives us a lot of practice.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_179.wav|Sadly, too, many of them are similar.|63,,
wav48/p293/p293_180.wav|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_181.wav|However, it is believed they were from the Highlands.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_182.wav|Britain hasn't seen it in this way.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_183.wav|The crucial strike was yet to come.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_184.wav|It was his job to check.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_185.wav|This is the stuff of live music.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_186.wav|Mrs Taylor is taking legal advice.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_187.wav|Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_188.wav|But Allen is deadly serious.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_189.wav|It's a huge amount.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_190.wav|The fire was falling from the sky.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_191.wav|So he was anxious to try something new.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_192.wav|But he is something special, is he not?|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_193.wav|This is simply unjust.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_194.wav|A final decision is expected by Friday.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_195.wav|We will do so again.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_196.wav|We will only move forward.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_197.wav|I'm a bit annoyed.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_198.wav|It ignores the future.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_199.wav|I am just looking to God.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_200.wav|I always savour the company of The Voice.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_201.wav|What's the rush?|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_202.wav|It would also take time.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_203.wav|Nothing is ruled out.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_204.wav|We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_205.wav|He doesn't have to like it, but he must accept it.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_206.wav|I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_207.wav|He was also married with two children.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_208.wav|His conclusion is upbeat.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_209.wav|Clearly, we could go on like this all day.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_210.wav|The investment programme will deliver these improvements.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_211.wav|Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.|63,,
wav48/p293/p293_212.wav|I'm just gonna hit the shot.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_213.wav|He will not be carrying out any surgery.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_214.wav|The replacements made a big difference.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_215.wav|We expect to come through on Thursday.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_216.wav|A web site's planned for November.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_217.wav|He didn't know it was his audition, but it was.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_218.wav|The salary changes are long overdue.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_219.wav|He is, indeed, the grandson of travelling folk.|63,,
wav48/p293/p293_220.wav|Who would be in that desert?|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_221.wav|It will take some time to establish.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_222.wav|Sadly the jury were not convinced.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_223.wav|We never got off the bus.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_224.wav|I've had six days of rehearsal.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_225.wav|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_226.wav|They have to come up with a solution.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_227.wav|The report will be launched in Glasgow today.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_228.wav|These will be finally corrected by next week.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_229.wav|They will form a tribute.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_230.wav|We had no idea that this letter existed.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_231.wav|I think in three dimensions.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_232.wav|Three others were wounded.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_233.wav|They had four children together.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_234.wav|It's a way of making a mark.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_235.wav|There is a great carry over value.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_236.wav|Life, as many people know it, in other words.|63,,
wav48/p293/p293_237.wav|That was my own personal decision.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_238.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.|63,,
wav48/p293/p293_239.wav|She returned home a few days later.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_240.wav|I have been here for only three months.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_241.wav|So what's wrong with Scotland?|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_242.wav|She had been in Germany for medical treatment.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_243.wav|How can they engage with the work?|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_244.wav|It gave me something to focus on.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_245.wav|We live by the rule of law.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_246.wav|He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_247.wav|She is fulfilled by it.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_248.wav|But one shouldn't go by that.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_249.wav|Nobody has been put on trial.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_250.wav|Advice and counselling will be offered.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_251.wav|Also, he was flawed.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_252.wav|That's why he plays for Scotland.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_253.wav|I just could not cope.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_254.wav|They may differ on other issues.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_255.wav|In short, the club was broke.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_256.wav|The protest will go ahead as planned.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_257.wav|There is no dispute with the Iraqi people.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_258.wav|That fight begins today for freedom and liberty.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_259.wav|I find the whole affair disturbing.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_260.wav|Is it the players, or is it the coaches?|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_261.wav|Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_262.wav|The Commons is too outdated.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_263.wav|It feels like a privilege.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_264.wav|We have got a full house tonight.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_265.wav|It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_266.wav|He will be advised by me.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_267.wav|It's been quite a turnaround for Miami.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_268.wav|Our children are our future.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_269.wav|It's part of your life.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_270.wav|The defender made an impressive debut.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_271.wav|I was furious about it.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_272.wav|They were not doing it too well, either.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_273.wav|It is typical of me.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_274.wav|There are two offerings from Scotland.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_275.wav|Life becomes a song.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_276.wav|I know you went back this morning.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_277.wav|It has, however, been a long time coming.|63,,
wav48/p293/p293_278.wav|This avalanche is just beginning.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_279.wav|That, however, is only part of their story.|63,,
wav48/p293/p293_280.wav|Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_281.wav|I was living with my mum.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_282.wav|We very much regret that it has occurred.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_283.wav|The whole process was so different.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_284.wav|The BBC was a disgrace.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_285.wav|They feel it belongs to them.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_286.wav|I don't know why she is not here.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_287.wav|They certainly do not socialise.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_288.wav|Police have refused to name the couple involved.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_289.wav|They have got their position, we have got our position.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_290.wav|There was still more disquiet in Israel.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_291.wav|He had played well in that central role.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_292.wav|We told them in June.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_293.wav|If so, we want to hear from them.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_294.wav|They never gave up hope.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_295.wav|Construction is due to begin in February.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_296.wav|I'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_297.wav|It was just another race, and yesterday is history.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_298.wav|The red card was okay.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_300.wav|We remain committed to it, as does the government.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_301.wav|But they will not be compelled to join.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_302.wav|It will vote with the US.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_303.wav|There will be no disruption to teaching.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_304.wav|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_305.wav|No, we had nothing to do with the Jews.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_306.wav|Again the verdict was not proven.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_307.wav|We've just got to work a bit better.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_308.wav|The likelihood is that it will be negative.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_309.wav|That suggests that out fitness is good.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_310.wav|But she's also beautiful behind the face.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_311.wav|Four had been brought down.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_312.wav|The British public is nothing if not fickle.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_313.wav|Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_314.wav|It is also claimed that he was murdered.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_315.wav|We will build upon the basic state pension.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_316.wav|Last year, however, was a different story.|63,,
wav48/p293/p293_317.wav|I'm confident we can turn things around.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_318.wav|Tomorrow we begin again as New Yorkers.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_319.wav|Frankly, they have to crack down.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_320.wav|Eleven events are required.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_321.wav|The ministers are now to make their decision.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_322.wav|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_323.wav|That's just the kind of thing we have.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_324.wav|I bought a car at auction.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_325.wav|You've gotten all the facts.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_326.wav|It possibly depends on the position.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_327.wav|Life is too short.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_328.wav|What is the Working Families Tax Credit?|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_329.wav|The event has now gone to Helsinki.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_330.wav|He's very young but he is growing up.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_331.wav|He is in charge on the pitch.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_332.wav|Detectives are waiting to interview the men.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_333.wav|SOMETIMES, it's not what you say that counts.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_334.wav|For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_335.wav|They had asked not to be named.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_336.wav|Well, until recently he didn't think so.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_337.wav|A whole range of factors are involved.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_338.wav|There may be some work in construction, but not enough.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_339.wav|They would love to do more films.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_340.wav|I have great sympathy with these people.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_341.wav|He wanted someone young and ambitious.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_342.wav|Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_343.wav|It raises a serious question mark.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_344.wav|He is dying from cancer.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_345.wav|The package has been properly costed.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_346.wav|The attitude and commitment was decent.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_347.wav|The feeling is awesome.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_348.wav|He quit in October.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_349.wav|The family also declined to discuss the case.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_350.wav|Famously, though, there was a catch.|63,,
wav48/p293/p293_351.wav|Today, we begin to answer that question.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_352.wav|Barry will be able to handle this.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_354.wav|Failure is a curious concept.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_355.wav|But it can happen for Tiger.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_356.wav|Patients will be partners in decision making.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_357.wav|We're very excited and challenged by the project.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_358.wav|The science is well known, the solution is simple.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_359.wav|The initial reaction was disbelief.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_360.wav|All these things have an impact.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_361.wav|For some, it might not make too much difference.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_362.wav|I now know that from memory.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_363.wav|She is believed to be in South Africa.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_364.wav|I felt we had fallen back a little.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_365.wav|He doesn't even know who he is.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_366.wav|This is our chance in Northern Ireland.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_367.wav|Hopefully, the goals will return on Wednesday.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_368.wav|The men are safe and unharmed.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_369.wav|I don't know what we're doing wrong.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_370.wav|I can't wait for the outdoors.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_371.wav|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_372.wav|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_373.wav|But it was to no avail.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_374.wav|I don't think the referees are against us.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_375.wav|The whole experience has left me bitter.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_376.wav|It is not a road of life.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_377.wav|This must be kept in total perspective.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_378.wav|It is three years at present.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_379.wav|My husband was fighting for his life.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_380.wav|As often as not, the cause remains a mystery.|63,,,
wav48/p293/p293_381.wav|When he took over it really took off.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_382.wav|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_383.wav|The penalty was the turning point.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_384.wav|I have chosen to do this research.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_385.wav|It was even worse than at home.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_386.wav|Michael's putting on a brave face.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_387.wav|This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_388.wav|I am sure that this will happen again.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_389.wav|He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_390.wav|All were within range of Israeli cities.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_391.wav|I do not believe they are.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_392.wav|The aircraft was totally destroyed.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_393.wav|What happens when the funding is exhausted.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_394.wav|She's the runner - she makes the decisions.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_395.wav|This is a completely new experience for me.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_396.wav|I should never have come over to Fife.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_397.wav|What kind of person is he?|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_398.wav|Their bid was a very good one.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_399.wav|Green is desperate to play in The Open.|63,,,,
wav48/p293/p293_400.wav|And this tournament will travel.|63,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_001.wav|Please call Stella.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|64,,
wav48/p294/p294_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|64,,
wav48/p294/p294_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|64,,
wav48/p294/p294_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it's not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|64,,
wav48/p294/p294_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|64,,
wav48/p294/p294_025.wav|They were the better team on the night.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_026.wav|The show is sold out, like the others in the run.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_027.wav|It means we have to have some patience.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_028.wav|For the moment, our position remains the same.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_029.wav|I was pregnant and very worried.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_030.wav|He said she was mad.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_031.wav|They were impressive against France.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_032.wav|I am delighted at Murray's appointment.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_033.wav|The airport was even different.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_034.wav|Other people had looked at it.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_035.wav|A neighbour said the street was shocked.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_036.wav|Michael, he is running!|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_037.wav|He was taken to hospital, but later died.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_038.wav|Their ambition is to go back.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_039.wav|He got the same story.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_040.wav|My view has now changed completely.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_041.wav|I've been dying for an hour.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_042.wav|It wasn't a flight of fancy.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_043.wav|We're playing away from home and that's it.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_044.wav|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_045.wav|They tend to be female and retired.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_046.wav|Who was the mystery MP?|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_047.wav|This was no accident.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_048.wav|I'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_049.wav|We've all done it!|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_050.wav|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_051.wav|Hopefully, that'll come from someone on our side.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_052.wav|The course record was in his name.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_053.wav|But we welcome this document.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_054.wav|What is the point of jailing him?|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_055.wav|We should not bring him into a dispute.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_056.wav|This is a possible way forward.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_057.wav|I am not here to get even.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_058.wav|Freedom from Serbia is a growing objective.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_059.wav|We are only human.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_060.wav|I went with the mood.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_061.wav|I think we'll just keep it.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_062.wav|Debate is not just talk.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_063.wav|How is he enjoying life as a senior?|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_064.wav|It is all about having physical evidence.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_065.wav|People remember the Tories in office.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_066.wav|What kind of inclusion is that?|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_067.wav|I fell in love with it right away.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_068.wav|Domestic abuse is related to power and control.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_069.wav|It makes for an interesting conference.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_070.wav|I don't have any answer for them.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_071.wav|It took about five or six hours.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_072.wav|I found the course inspiring.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_073.wav|Two things were clear from the new programme.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_074.wav|This is the real thing now.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_075.wav|Until they came to do it.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_076.wav|She now lives in London.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_077.wav|It will not be a long campaign.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_078.wav|Subs not used, McGraw.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_079.wav|Three bystanders were killed.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_080.wav|One policeman was killed.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_081.wav|They could not have done more for me.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_082.wav|It was like a vacuum.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_083.wav|That was enough for the committee.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_084.wav|It is a very genuine prospect.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_085.wav|It is the tip of the iceberg.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_086.wav|We have to focus on what is important.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_087.wav|They have to work so hard.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_088.wav|It's not very pretty, but it's effective.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_089.wav|Seven British members of the club are missing.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_090.wav|He had just returned from a run.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_091.wav|There's a strong involvement.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_092.wav|Now, though, he has an incentive.|64,,
wav48/p294/p294_093.wav|But now it's back to golf.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_094.wav|It should be a condition of employment.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_095.wav|Was it a signal?|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_096.wav|It may not even be possible.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_097.wav|In fact, they go hand in hand.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_098.wav|I gave him a way out, and he took it.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_099.wav|So is that it, then?|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_100.wav|You should have let it write the cards.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_101.wav|It's annoying in a way.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_102.wav|It's too close to call.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_103.wav|It's a long process.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_104.wav|I asked to take it up to Glasgow.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_105.wav|Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_106.wav|The other conditions were not specified.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_107.wav|I've never felt affection for Emu.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_108.wav|That's not part of the deal.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_109.wav|That was the context of his remarks.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_110.wav|This has gone on too long.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_111.wav|We have great confidence in Derek.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_112.wav|My ambition is to tell a good story.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_113.wav|I don't know the nature of the illness.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_114.wav|The industry will try to get round it.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_115.wav|Who will deliver more service to Scotland?|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_116.wav|I want to make a vigorous defence.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_117.wav|And she got it.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_118.wav|We are the weakest link.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_119.wav|We have now no choice.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_120.wav|My father and mother are.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_121.wav|We don't know what happened after.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_122.wav|Did he just want to be on telly?|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_123.wav|He seems to be used to the attention.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_124.wav|It's an hour of the same response.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_125.wav|We have very real concerns about it.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_126.wav|He has gone through the process before.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_127.wav|People will see this over time.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_128.wav|I can't speak for him.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_129.wav|They were married in Edinburgh last summer.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_130.wav|The lowest increase was recorded in Dundee.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_131.wav|I can't see him reversing that.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_132.wav|I'm deeply sorry they did.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_133.wav|I can lead by example.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_134.wav|I have had a wonderful career.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_135.wav|It seemed to have direction.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_136.wav|This takes the pressure off.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_137.wav|It was different in the endurance events.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_138.wav|Above all, the approach is upbeat.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_139.wav|The objective was achieved.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_140.wav|It was a hugely popular decision.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_141.wav|He invented the language.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_142.wav|Where are they?|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_143.wav|It's hard not to.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_144.wav|It is a question of life and death.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_145.wav|However, there are no plans for injecting rooms.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_146.wav|You ask the question.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_147.wav|She was always a quality act.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_148.wav|We are all very proud of her.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_149.wav|I'm sure that is not.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_150.wav|It's a great idea.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_151.wav|It's like a score in some ways.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_152.wav|It's a wonderful piece of water.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_153.wav|Feel the air, the space.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_154.wav|Therein lies the problem.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_155.wav|You feel the pride.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_156.wav|We are well insured.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_157.wav|I was quietly confident about getting the win.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_158.wav|The Treasury denied the claims.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_159.wav|You've been working for four years.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_160.wav|I am the Son of Sam.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_161.wav|There is no shortage of commitment.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_162.wav|Such as it is.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_163.wav|He deserves a second chance.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_164.wav|He also admitted.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_165.wav|There was no change in the strategy.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_166.wav|There's been a mistake.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_167.wav|It had until tomorrow to comply.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_168.wav|Genetic assessment is crucial.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_169.wav|I enjoy my work.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_170.wav|We have managed to get it under control.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_171.wav|We have a genuine budget in place.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_172.wav|Art is still a risky investment.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_173.wav|It was little else.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_174.wav|These things can happen.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_175.wav|Family members are at her bedside.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_176.wav|You have to go to the edges.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_177.wav|I'm looking forward to facing the Irishmen.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_178.wav|Harry will be up for it.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_179.wav|He could tell you.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_180.wav|My place is in the kitchen.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_181.wav|He was, indeed, a thoroughly decent man.|64,,
wav48/p294/p294_182.wav|A decision is expected in September.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_183.wav|It was a big departure.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_184.wav|That's the name of the game, though.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_185.wav|It's a huge amount.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_186.wav|The fire was falling from the sky.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_187.wav|I want my mum.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_188.wav|This is simply unjust.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_189.wav|The First Minister is an addict.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_190.wav|Its role is not to interfere.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_191.wav|It is becoming a bit of a habit.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_192.wav|You can't believe a word.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_193.wav|Something happened on that island.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_194.wav|You can't get a mortgage.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_195.wav|It is misleading to compare the two.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_196.wav|I want a career.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_197.wav|He said nothing to waiting journalists.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_198.wav|O Leary was clearly disgusted.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_199.wav|That's been the case for a while.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_200.wav|When it is ready, it will be signed.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_201.wav|All options are on the table.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_202.wav|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_203.wav|We now have a moment of hope.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_204.wav|They should not be blamed for it.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_205.wav|Our traditions and cultures remain the same.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_206.wav|The first eviction takes place on Sunday.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_207.wav|It will take some time to establish.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_208.wav|This club is perfect for me.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_209.wav|And do you know, it just wasn't the same.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_210.wav|This came as no great surprise to anyone.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_211.wav|I love this job.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_212.wav|I have no secrets.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_213.wav|We are very, very pleased with the response.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_214.wav|He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_215.wav|They will form a tribute.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_216.wav|We're very, very excited.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_217.wav|It's not a question of talking.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_218.wav|He was certainly upbeat about his chances.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_219.wav|Then they killed another three.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_220.wav|We are not a retailer, we provide a service.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_221.wav|The six others were injured.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_222.wav|She has so much to offer.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_223.wav|They are not the answer to staff shortages.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_224.wav|It should be a pretty exciting session.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_225.wav|Gas is too expensive.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_226.wav|Advice and counselling will be offered.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_227.wav|Are we going mainstream?|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_228.wav|I could not believe what they were saying.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_229.wav|The protest will go ahead as planned.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_230.wav|Who will run the bigger show?|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_231.wav|General, You didn't get a modified.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_232.wav|I'm not a little girl.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_233.wav|We have seen the future, and it is different.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_234.wav|Who does he think will win?|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_235.wav|We're talking about one or two years.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_236.wav|I just have to accept that.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_237.wav|He was overwhelmed by the response.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_238.wav|They will do nothing for the local people.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_239.wav|Do it for us now.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_240.wav|We got the guarantee.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_241.wav|I couldn't have asked for better.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_242.wav|That is however, the only part of the story.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_243.wav|But happily, the story is true.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_244.wav|They are not suitable.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_245.wav|Some days are different from others.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_247.wav|Everything else is the same.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_248.wav|They never gave up hope.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_249.wav|But it was a pleasure.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_250.wav|There are no excuses left for us.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_251.wav|Mental health is a massive issue.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_252.wav|His director of football is leaving.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_253.wav|We don't want to be too intrusive.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_254.wav|Their own instinctive response was confirmed.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_255.wav|There are still some matters to be discussed.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_256.wav|This would give Scotland around eight members.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_257.wav|I get on him, he gets on me.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_258.wav|They are in care for a reason.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_259.wav|A Scotsman has to defend his castle.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_260.wav|I haven't a clue.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_261.wav|It has certainly not been an enjoyable experience.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_262.wav|I thought he was terrific.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_263.wav|A statement is expected in April.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_264.wav|It possibly depends on the position.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_265.wav|This will have no effect on the championship.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_266.wav|We didn't turn it into the inspectors.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_267.wav|I would love to travel with it.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_268.wav|Detectives are waiting to interview the men.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_269.wav|It is a common condition in children.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_270.wav|We will work through the night.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_271.wav|I also thought, This is a feature film.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_272.wav|For now, they have gone as far as they can.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_273.wav|Boy is the town a mess.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_274.wav|It's as simple as that.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_275.wav|We've been here before.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_276.wav|Neither of them was badly hurt.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_277.wav|From there, it was a success story.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_278.wav|It is a very disturbing picture for men.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_279.wav|I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_280.wav|It was one in the afternoon.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_281.wav|I've never seen them down here.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_282.wav|For some, it might not make too much difference.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_283.wav|This is our unfinished business.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_284.wav|This is our chance in Northern Ireland.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_285.wav|He had asked if they had the script.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_286.wav|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_287.wav|This could take a few days.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_288.wav|A great deal was achieved.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_289.wav|So it was sad.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_290.wav|It's a blunt instrument anyway.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_291.wav|There did not need to be a miracle.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_292.wav|This could also affect the sentencing.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_293.wav|That case has still not been settled.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_294.wav|What do they do, anyway?|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_295.wav|They've got a mountain to climb.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_296.wav|It just would not work.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_297.wav|The acting left a lot to be desired.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_298.wav|Who will provide the wine?|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_299.wav|We started from scratch.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_300.wav|There was no happiness.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_301.wav|Their bid was a very good one.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_302.wav|Everything is so commercial.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_303.wav|And this tournament will travel.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_304.wav|Could it have been better spent?|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_305.wav|If that is the case, it is a breakthrough.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_306.wav|The order went out.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_307.wav|Cinema is a communal experience.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_308.wav|The appeal is impartial.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_309.wav|You could see he was thinking about it.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_310.wav|He added, We are full of anger.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_311.wav|They have nowhere else to go.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_312.wav|However, it seems that he got it wrong.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_313.wav|We work for the athlete.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_314.wav|It is three years at present.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_315.wav|The document is a starting point for discussion.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_316.wav|We all make mistakes.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_317.wav|It didn't put me off.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_318.wav|Now they have found out the truth.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_319.wav|It is an impressive record.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_320.wav|Johnson was pretty low.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_321.wav|We know we have done wrong.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_322.wav|She was married with one son.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_323.wav|I wanted to drop out.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_324.wav|I told you so.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_325.wav|He's a good player, but he's not the only one.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_326.wav|Which is where the manager comes in.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_327.wav|Is that what people we want?|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_328.wav|There are so many unanswered questions.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_329.wav|Then it was into a series of classes.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_330.wav|He wants to play in the Champions League.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_331.wav|I'm so happy that she did.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_332.wav|The need for further investment is obvious.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_333.wav|Iraq has no interest in war.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_334.wav|It's hard, but we have had so much to do.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_335.wav|But it took a lot of bottle.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_336.wav|Holiday was certainly no stranger to bigotry.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_337.wav|That period was a struggle.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_338.wav|No-one else was hurt.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_339.wav|What's it for?|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_340.wav|Downing Street defended the scale of the awards.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_341.wav|Anything can happen - at any moment.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_342.wav|She is an imposing presence.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_343.wav|There are moments of joy in politics.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_344.wav|Is a drug dealer?|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_345.wav|Where are you taking her?|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_346.wav|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_347.wav|It's just not our biggest problem.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_348.wav|The result could be all down to turnout.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_349.wav|I'm not going to change from it.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_350.wav|There were no violations.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_351.wav|That was the type of man he was.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_352.wav|They are not falling now.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_353.wav|They had to explain it.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_354.wav|We didn't mean to kill him.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_355.wav|The support of Britain is assumed.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_356.wav|So far he has not done so.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_357.wav|He completely loses control.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_358.wav|No decision on that was taken.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_359.wav|My fitness was very poor.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_360.wav|The trial continues today.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_361.wav|People come to see the Highlands.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_362.wav|Europe is a bonus.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_363.wav|It is also used to buy coffins.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_364.wav|I've got to provide for my family.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_365.wav|Such debate is pointless.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_366.wav|And it had two seats.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_367.wav|Cooking is intricate and complex.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_368.wav|He found it very hard to understand.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_369.wav|But it would change the context.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_370.wav|But who was driving it?|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_371.wav|We recorded it at our own expense.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_372.wav|But opponents were quick to criticise.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_373.wav|Try to save us.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_374.wav|We also have had to work the dark side, if you will.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_375.wav|We need to increase the membership.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_376.wav|Social workers are on stand-by to help.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_377.wav|Certainly, there is much on the agenda.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_378.wav|There could be a way back.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_379.wav|He edited the press release.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_380.wav|Visitors were also impressed.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_381.wav|It was very, very difficult for me to look at this.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_382.wav|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_383.wav|Are there muscular problems?|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_384.wav|We had our chances.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_385.wav|However, many questions remained unanswered.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_386.wav|I told her, and she was extremely grateful.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_387.wav|He is in the queue.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_388.wav|But what is?|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_389.wav|It wasn't about her singing, though.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_390.wav|We have other options.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_391.wav|Calvin was back at his best today.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_392.wav|My mind was made up.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_393.wav|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_394.wav|And rugby fans can help.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_395.wav|The council's concern is very simple.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_396.wav|We are on the path of change.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_397.wav|Rangers didn't turn up, by the way.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_398.wav|No other vehicle was involved in the accident.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_399.wav|It's very simple, no-one is forced to compete.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_400.wav|Of course, it doesn't all come off.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_401.wav|In fact, he should never have been in the field.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_402.wav|He promised a final decision within a fortnight.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_403.wav|We will deal with the refugees.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_404.wav|The pair are no strangers to smashing records.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_405.wav|It's a tragedy for the area.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_406.wav|It was very well received.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_407.wav|I don't think there's going to be one.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_408.wav|If you could find it.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_409.wav|Such is the ego involved.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_410.wav|Mr Wilson has received no such request.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_411.wav|It raises the edge.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_412.wav|It was not known to myself.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_413.wav|It is a delight on every level.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_414.wav|Would it really be good to shorten it?|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_415.wav|I don't entirely buy that.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_416.wav|England could not take anything for granted, however.|64,,,
wav48/p294/p294_417.wav|I saw it in a different way.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_418.wav|Or, rather, it isn't.|64,,
wav48/p294/p294_419.wav|We have every respect for Michelle.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_420.wav|Mr Blunkett was convinced.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_421.wav|The auction will be held tomorrow.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_422.wav|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_423.wav|Athletics is on a roll in the country.|64,,,,
wav48/p294/p294_424.wav|He died at the hands of his captors.|64,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_001.wav|Please call Stella.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|65,,
wav48/p295/p295_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|65,,
wav48/p295/p295_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|65,,
wav48/p295/p295_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_025.wav|It has never been worthwhile.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_026.wav|She was on the edge of breaking point.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_027.wav|However, the following year the cancer returned.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_028.wav|Because we do not need it.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_029.wav|It has been supremely successful.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_030.wav|He's a good player, but he's not the only one.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_031.wav|Which is where the manager comes in.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_032.wav|Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_033.wav|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_034.wav|We thought we would never see them again.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_035.wav|After that, it's a step into the unknown.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_036.wav|She asked me for the appointment with me.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_037.wav|He must not be removed from office.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_038.wav|That means an extra two years.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_039.wav|I think he was nervous to begin with.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_040.wav|Our children are the future of our society.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_041.wav|I'm sure he would love it.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_042.wav|A final agreement has not yet been completed.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_043.wav|It's just not our biggest problem.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_044.wav|It is just like any other club.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_045.wav|Everything is possible in football.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_046.wav|I'm sure he didn't mean it.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_048.wav|We are going to New Broomfield to win.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_049.wav|Colin is free to speak with other teams.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_050.wav|He declined to give further details.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_051.wav|I think it was entirely the right decision.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_052.wav|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_053.wav|For sure we want to win it.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_054.wav|There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_055.wav|Such debate is pointless.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_056.wav|He is helping police with their inquiries.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_057.wav|We recorded it at our own expense.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_058.wav|A formal decision will be announced within months.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_059.wav|I knew there was a challenge for me.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_060.wav|Social workers are on stand-by to help.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_061.wav|I just have no maternal instincts.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_062.wav|If you're going to do it, do it right.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_063.wav|They have a car and cannot afford another.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_064.wav|It is, after all, a very funny play.|65,,
wav48/p295/p295_065.wav|Can you imagine a world without design?|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_066.wav|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.|65,,
wav48/p295/p295_067.wav|And he listens to his artists as well.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_068.wav|I really couldn't believe it had actually happened.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_069.wav|SO now we know the secret.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_070.wav|He's right up to a point.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_071.wav|We would have looked out for each other.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_072.wav|I had no choice but to leave.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_073.wav|Where does he go from here?|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_074.wav|Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_075.wav|This time, there were no such rewards.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_076.wav|But then they scored their fourth.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_077.wav|He said, My own position is quite simple.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_078.wav|But let's not get ahead of ourselves.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_079.wav|It has to find out what went wrong.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_080.wav|People are already enjoying it.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_081.wav|We're just delighted to be back on top.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_082.wav|Or is it the European approach?|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_083.wav|I had found my vision.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_084.wav|Mr Wilson has received no such request.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_085.wav|However, we have not come to any conclusions.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_086.wav|There is a contract in existence for Allan.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_087.wav|I don't entirely buy that.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_088.wav|We are very hopeful he will be cleared.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_089.wav|It is giving out the wrong message.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_090.wav|It didn't come as any great surprise.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_091.wav|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_092.wav|As a nation, we must become more active.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_093.wav|Nothing has changed from the season before.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_094.wav|I'm not thinking too much about the tour.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_095.wav|I had some time with Aston Villa.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_096.wav|We recognise it as a key area.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_097.wav|The mood was euphoric.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_098.wav|The time of judgment has arrived.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_099.wav|Mind you, it wouldn't be a bad idea.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_100.wav|You can take it almost anywhere and practise.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_101.wav|We want to be separate from our neighbours.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_102.wav|Eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_103.wav|Have you heard anything from Paramount?|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_104.wav|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_105.wav|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_106.wav|This has been a terrible experience.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_107.wav|He had a different agenda entirely.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_108.wav|Casualties are a problem for the Kremlin.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_109.wav|We're in a state of shock and disbelief.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_110.wav|That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_111.wav|She said she would not welcome the flowers.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_112.wav|It is reform in return for resources.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_113.wav|It offers a different viewpoint.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_114.wav|The band was good, and it's been a great day.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_115.wav|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_116.wav|I have no plans to retire.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_117.wav|The Scots are, however, in good company.|65,,
wav48/p295/p295_118.wav|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_119.wav|There were far more pressing matters to consider.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_120.wav|The whole thing in general is moving on.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_121.wav|This is a test of our character.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_122.wav|They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_123.wav|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_124.wav|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.|65,,
wav48/p295/p295_125.wav|The look on his face was something special.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_126.wav|You have a very persuasive president.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_127.wav|Sure, we have problems.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_128.wav|We will provide immediate access.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_129.wav|Axis itself was created from that exercise.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_130.wav|Five years later, the deception continued.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_131.wav|Obviously, people are worried in the West Midlands.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_132.wav|I can't see myself in one of those.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_133.wav|We are pursuing legal action against the government.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_134.wav|I wondered about changing back to rugby.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_135.wav|He added, We have the same desire.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_137.wav|It was, for me, like a week in heaven.|65,,
wav48/p295/p295_138.wav|I haven't had a lesson in four years.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_139.wav|That, however, is the end of the good news.|65,,
wav48/p295/p295_140.wav|Seven people were later detained by police.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_141.wav|I got very, very tired.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_142.wav|What did you learn in school today?|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_143.wav|He certainly didn't say he was a journalist.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_144.wav|It does affect the staff and the prisoners.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_145.wav|He's working hard on that right now.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_146.wav|The jury is still out.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_147.wav|Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_148.wav|At the moment, the success in Germany is good.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_149.wav|I can't say that this is very usual.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_150.wav|We opened up and everything was gone.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_151.wav|However, everyone should do it once in their life.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_152.wav|We are right at the heart of Europe.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_153.wav|I try to be open to experience.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_154.wav|I remember it clearly.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_155.wav|I'm sure they will be very happy.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_156.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_157.wav|We must get the three points.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_158.wav|There has been a fair bit in between, too.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_159.wav|I feel alive and good today.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_160.wav|We're in England for the time being.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_161.wav|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_162.wav|David Trimble has sold out.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_163.wav|Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_164.wav|The voters are our masters.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_165.wav|This is great news - a wonderful addition to the programme.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_166.wav|He is willing to pay the required amount.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_167.wav|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_168.wav|He should emerge as the winner.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_169.wav|That's probably the hard bit about being dropped.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_170.wav|We've had an enjoyable adventure.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_171.wav|The story was being repeated across Scotland.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_172.wav|You're not going to forget something like that.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_173.wav|They are in the euro.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_174.wav|The driver was unhurt.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_175.wav|Anything that can be done, the Government will do.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_176.wav|It's all about money, money, money.|65,,
wav48/p295/p295_177.wav|A bit of match fitness is required.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_178.wav|It was far from business as usual.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_179.wav|There's nothing new in that argument.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_180.wav|Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_181.wav|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_182.wav|That's when you hope to take advantage.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_183.wav|The deadline is real and absolute.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_184.wav|No means testing will be required.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_185.wav|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_186.wav|I'm sure it will go on.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_187.wav|He was born in London of Scottish parents.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_188.wav|She is still very poorly.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_189.wav|That's how he did the damage.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_190.wav|He added, It is all about the search for power.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_191.wav|I need a publishing deal!|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_192.wav|They tried to give her advice.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_193.wav|If we live forever, can we really be said to live?|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_194.wav|Defeat is simply not an option.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_195.wav|We have all been there at some point.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_196.wav|Recent reports suggested it might be sold off.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_197.wav|If they don't want to read it, they don't have to.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_198.wav|At least two women were among those arrested.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_199.wav|My intentions are to go on like this.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_200.wav|It is not attempting to offer a solution.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_201.wav|She didn't tell me anything the night before.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_202.wav|I will be having talks with the workforce.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_203.wav|It's like an extension of your body.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_204.wav|That's why he is a national treasure.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_205.wav|It seems a waste of talents.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_206.wav|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_207.wav|That is a trend which will be encouraged.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_208.wav|Last night they were being comforted by relatives.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_209.wav|We need to know more about her.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_210.wav|And what is she escaping from?|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_211.wav|Leaving the Labour Party is one thing.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_212.wav|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_213.wav|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_214.wav|What happened in this instance is serious misconduct.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_215.wav|The distinction is also supported by doctors.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_216.wav|I don't know how they make the weight.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_217.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_218.wav|She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_219.wav|I'm very tired, but it was worth it.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_220.wav|The joint bid is still on course.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_221.wav|This is the best moment of my career.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_222.wav|My life has been turned upside down.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_224.wav|Why is he not fighting for the Union?|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_225.wav|Parole is a decision for me.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_226.wav|It left me with a sadness.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_227.wav|We don't have any senior players.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_228.wav|Not so, it transpires.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_229.wav|Knowledge is everything at this level.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_230.wav|This will help our confidence.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_231.wav|He has a wealth of experience.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_232.wav|It is a very beautiful city.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_233.wav|Her body was found on Monday morning.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_234.wav|His father and mother are in film production.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_235.wav|It's about attitudes to change.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_236.wav|I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_237.wav|We have seen the failure of politics.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_238.wav|The party will make up its own mind.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_239.wav|His remarks appear to have had an effect.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_240.wav|I am very sorry to hear about this.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_241.wav|I'm delighted, and the players were brilliant.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_242.wav|Hopefully we can put in a performance.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_243.wav|When he came to see me on Monday.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_244.wav|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_245.wav|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_246.wav|Their condition was described as stable yesterday.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_247.wav|Next league matches, Dundee United - Motherwell.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_248.wav|It became a book by itself.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_249.wav|Here, the fans have been fantastic.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_250.wav|She was close to suicide at one stage.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_251.wav|It is like a theatre of the absurd.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_252.wav|What kind of festival is proposed?|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_253.wav|In my experience, he does not do that.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_254.wav|We're all involved in creating the work.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_255.wav|When we started the album.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_256.wav|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_257.wav|Controllers major concern is safety.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_258.wav|This is your country.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_259.wav|That's the most important thing for me.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_260.wav|But it was the sensible thing to do.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_261.wav|I think it'll be a great occasion.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_262.wav|The committees are due to report next year.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_263.wav|It was seriously unpleasant.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_264.wav|What was the cause of all this outrage?|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_265.wav|Now, she has completed a family tradition.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_266.wav|The bombing has had a huge influence.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_267.wav|However, the groups denied the claims.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_268.wav|This latter point is hugely important.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_269.wav|The airport was even different.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_270.wav|Whether this return was too soon.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_271.wav|We're playing away from home and that's it.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_272.wav|It may be down, but New York is not out.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_273.wav|In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_274.wav|The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_275.wav|My view has now completely changed.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_276.wav|Manchester United are the classic example.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_277.wav|I've never regretted my decision.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_278.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_279.wav|Glasgow is about to enter a new era.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_280.wav|Look at the Liberal Democrats.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_281.wav|Surely it can't get any worse.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_282.wav|He's in a lot of pain, it is very distressing.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_283.wav|We still have a long, long way to go.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_284.wav|He preferred to concentrate on the positive.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_285.wav|The Old Firm are going nowhere.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_286.wav|I'm not sure.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_287.wav|But the championship is not over yet.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_288.wav|WE live in a world of large numbers.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_289.wav|Agents and coaches must be paid.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_290.wav|Charges against the pair were found not proven.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_291.wav|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_292.wav|Anyone can still win this tournament.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_293.wav|My husband was angry.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_294.wav|You're going to die.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_295.wav|We have to put pressure on Rangers.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_296.wav|We're not really commenting on that.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_297.wav|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_298.wav|Ferguson is not interested in the finances.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_299.wav|Could they perhaps be related?|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_300.wav|It should be a condition of employment.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_301.wav|It was not being marketed properly.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_302.wav|Sub Not Used, McCormick.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_303.wav|They know their son was murdered.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_304.wav|I love this tournament.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_305.wav|Nobody will be forced to work.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_306.wav|We're all going to take a holiday.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_307.wav|It is good for Europe.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_308.wav|This is your chance.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_309.wav|They told him to go to drama school.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_310.wav|In order to get there, we have got to invest.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_311.wav|It felt like my support system was leaving.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_312.wav|The quality of life is difficult for them.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_313.wav|I think they are right to be impatient.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_314.wav|But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_315.wav|This year it will be Billy Crystal.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_316.wav|The attack was totally out of the blue.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_317.wav|It's a member of your family.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_318.wav|It's an hour of the same response.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_319.wav|There's a good chance of seeing something.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_320.wav|We were in different places, usually in cellars.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_321.wav|Thirteen people will be made redundant.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_322.wav|This was the performance, and the result they needed.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_323.wav|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_324.wav|It will not work in our favour.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_325.wav|We're very close to making it in Europe.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_326.wav|It was hugely popular decision.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_327.wav|The decision was left entirely to him.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_328.wav|They have been contrasting years, certainly.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_329.wav|These findings are vitally important.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_330.wav|That's always the case, isn't it?|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_331.wav|I certainly think it should be there.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_332.wav|I'm sure that they will learn.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_333.wav|His commitment, on the other hand, is clear.|65,,
wav48/p295/p295_335.wav|If he could have prevented it happening, he would have.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_336.wav|This time, however, may have been different.|65,,
wav48/p295/p295_337.wav|We are well insured.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_338.wav|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_339.wav|However, that could alter following the latest case.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_340.wav|It's like a garage.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_341.wav|The last few weeks have been really bad.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_342.wav|I believe in public services.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_343.wav|The atmosphere is businesslike.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_344.wav|But you can go beyond that condition.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_345.wav|Genetic assessment is crucial.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_346.wav|Tyson said he had made a mistake.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_347.wav|Four years is a long time.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_348.wav|This process of attrition is expected to continue.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_349.wav|No one wants to go through these things.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_350.wav|You'll get on like a house on fire.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_351.wav|All inquiries should be made to the police.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_352.wav|Worse still, it can be infectious.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_353.wav|They are a perfectly good thing in principle.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_354.wav|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_355.wav|He is very much in our thoughts.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_356.wav|So what could be better than becoming captain?|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_357.wav|Our Great Depression is our lives.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_358.wav|He was elected as a councillor last year.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_359.wav|You are always aware of the injury potential.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_360.wav|But that is entirely a matter for them.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_361.wav|But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_362.wav|One Minister said the reports were bizarre.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_363.wav|You're not going to get hurt.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_364.wav|But no decision has been made.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_365.wav|Our traditions and culture remain the same.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_366.wav|I decided not to renew the contract.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_367.wav|For us, that decision was hard to understand.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_368.wav|Life, as many people know it, in other words.|65,,
wav48/p295/p295_369.wav|There are so many artists working in Glasgow.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_370.wav|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_371.wav|She makes me feel very proud.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_372.wav|He had been surprised by the local reaction.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_373.wav|The voices told me to do it.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_374.wav|I am a committed European.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_375.wav|There is no point in looking any further.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_376.wav|A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_377.wav|I'm astonished by this decision.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_378.wav|General, You didn't get a modified.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_379.wav|Surely the answer is yes.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_380.wav|It's part of your life.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_381.wav|I could go on, but none of these things is true.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_382.wav|That sort of thing is long gone.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_383.wav|Our proposals are fully costed.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_384.wav|We all started running forward.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_385.wav|We did not want an absentee landlord.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_386.wav|That, however, is only part of the story.|65,,
wav48/p295/p295_387.wav|It worked well in Monaco.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_388.wav|Things were not easy from the outset.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_389.wav|The team is in division one in Spain.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_390.wav|We don't even know his name.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_391.wav|Our position is not a logic of war.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_392.wav|I have played really well all year.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_393.wav|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_394.wav|It was visibly on fire.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_395.wav|It was a fiery game.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_396.wav|This would give Scotland around eight members.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_397.wav|That is European law.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_398.wav|It was very lucky no-one was killed.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_399.wav|What has caused the demise of singing?|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_400.wav|He's close friend of Gordon Brown.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_401.wav|That is not a position they enjoy.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_402.wav|Blair also had a penalty.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_403.wav|We wanted to run away with her.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_404.wav|Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_405.wav|I am not retiring.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_406.wav|I didn't want to ignore the punters.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_407.wav|Boy is the town a mess.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_408.wav|Barry will be able to handle this.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_409.wav|It is a very disturbing picture for men.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_410.wav|To me, it was just a miracle.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_411.wav|After that, though, we are still waiting to see.|65,,
wav48/p295/p295_412.wav|That can happen so easily.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_413.wav|This is a really serious issue.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_414.wav|How do we get more people in?|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_415.wav|Scotland needs to hear it, too.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_416.wav|There is too much at stake for that.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_418.wav|We suspect he was pleased.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_419.wav|Everything is surrounded by confusion.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_420.wav|But, of course, it isn't.|65,,
wav48/p295/p295_421.wav|We are almost at that point, but not quite.|65,,,
wav48/p295/p295_422.wav|I have to say, for me, the game was not.|65,,
wav48/p295/p295_423.wav|The document is a starting point for discussion.|65,,,,
wav48/p295/p295_424.wav|There is still the question of his health.|65,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_001.wav|Please call Stella.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|66,,
wav48/p297/p297_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|66,,
wav48/p297/p297_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|66,,
wav48/p297/p297_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say that he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not a reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|66,,
wav48/p297/p297_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|66,,
wav48/p297/p297_025.wav|But it's been kept to a minimum.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_026.wav|We have gone on about him no end.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_027.wav|And the art of performance is taking risks.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_028.wav|Appointments should be made on merit.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_029.wav|I feel strongly about it.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_030.wav|Tommy is not a problem.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_031.wav|I started on fire a couple of times.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_032.wav|Jack McConnell will be making a statement tomorrow.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_033.wav|Other forces were, however, at work.|66,,
wav48/p297/p297_034.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_035.wav|The defender should have won the bloody ba.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_036.wav|In the meantime, everyone is taking everyone to court.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_037.wav|My fitness was very poor.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_038.wav|You have caught a serial killer.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_039.wav|Her mother said, She didn't look very well at all.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_040.wav|I am writing a novel.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_041.wav|Fewer people are being killed in accidents.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_042.wav|Sure the COE is a cracking band.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_043.wav|He, too, was unlucky not to get a goal.|66,,
wav48/p297/p297_044.wav|Bombing is the easy option.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_045.wav|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_046.wav|Except for this, it was offside.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_047.wav|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_048.wav|What do we do for an encore?|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_049.wav|Things start to talk to each other.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_050.wav|At the time, he was a living legend.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_051.wav|I would like to stay with Rangers.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_052.wav|All will be revealed in due course.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_053.wav|It was located on the remote control.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_054.wav|January is a bad time of year.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_055.wav|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_056.wav|That is an important part of our role.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_057.wav|From our point of view, it's the right time.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_058.wav|You just have to accept.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_059.wav|People will see this over time.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_060.wav|The tribunal continues today.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_061.wav|Basically, the classical tradition won out.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_062.wav|It obviously changes the prospects for getting agreement.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_063.wav|Nobody can get at them there.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_065.wav|It's not only my respect for them.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_066.wav|The police have an awful lot to explain.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_067.wav|BIG Brother is listening to you.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_068.wav|We will be paying agency rates.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_069.wav|This is a very high price.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_070.wav|In the end, however, it all came together.|66,,
wav48/p297/p297_071.wav|They can be time consuming.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_072.wav|It's a depressing, difficult and demanding job.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_074.wav|Subtle it is not.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_075.wav|If they don't, they can expect their funding to be cut.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_076.wav|I had a tie in my hand.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_077.wav|Raised the way you want it.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_078.wav|Football is very easy, you have to work for the team.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_079.wav|Then he did it twice.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_080.wav|We were short of athletes.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_081.wav|You have to do your research.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_082.wav|Things were so intense in the studio.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_083.wav|Its first awards will do just that.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_084.wav|It was the crowning point of my career.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_085.wav|You could feel the heat.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_086.wav|She is still very poorly.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_087.wav|That's how she wants to remember him.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_088.wav|Do something that you haven't done before.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_090.wav|We talk about effective military action.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_091.wav|Craig is a major concern for us.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_092.wav|The scientific debate is dead.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_093.wav|I sincerely hope not.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_094.wav|Broomfield was the centre of the town.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_095.wav|There is no such thing.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_096.wav|However, their reaction could not have been more different.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_097.wav|I was doing well at the hustings.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_098.wav|My wife and family are the support system.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_099.wav|The scheme is hopelessly failing.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_100.wav|The body follows the mind.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_101.wav|That gives it a spirit.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_102.wav|It isn't just a defining issue for them.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_103.wav|However, what is his calibre?|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_104.wav|If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_105.wav|Sub Not Used, McArthur.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_106.wav|And if he hadn't become a musician?|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_107.wav|No other vehicle was involved in the incident.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_108.wav|She died in middle age.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_109.wav|You need insurance to bring people in.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_110.wav|A great deal has been achieved.|66,,,,

wav48/p297/p297_134.wav|What did they think of her voice?|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_135.wav|Worse still, he might be singing Lady in Red.|66,,,

wav48/p297/p297_187.wav|I'll tell you honestly.|66,,,,

wav48/p297/p297_213.wav|The boys are very confident.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_215.wav|This club have been fair to me.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_216.wav|Secondly, there are other options for patients.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_217.wav|Access has been a nightmare.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_218.wav|What does she consider her greatest achievement?|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_219.wav|I'm looking at ways to do that now.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_220.wav|The first is in Whitehall, the second in Brussels.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_221.wav|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_222.wav|There has been no reaction from them.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_223.wav|She failed in her action.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_224.wav|The record companies have gone through the floor.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_225.wav|It was more like a Labour Party rally.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_226.wav|The group will report back in the summer.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_227.wav|She looked so young.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_228.wav|I will let you in on a secret.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_229.wav|Don't you think it was a fine performance?|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_230.wav|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_231.wav|Well, they were the unlucky ones.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_232.wav|She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_233.wav|We need a visionary producer.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_234.wav|I enjoyed my work in the Scottish Office.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_235.wav|Some were close to tears.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_236.wav|I saw it at a ruck.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_237.wav|I have great confidence in Annabelle.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_238.wav|He's a sort of mystery figure.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_239.wav|Europe is not a threat to Britain.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_240.wav|He just wants to leave a legacy.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_241.wav|Every game against New Zealand is.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_242.wav|Dialogue is the key.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_243.wav|But they didn't much like that.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_244.wav|We just wish they had done so before.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_245.wav|I am sorry to hear this news.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_246.wav|However we're capable of beating them.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_247.wav|They chose the latter.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_248.wav|I've not said anything to them, they know.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_249.wav|It's like a high school play.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_250.wav|That is how it will be judged.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_251.wav|It's there for people to look at.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_254.wav|Who did the recruiting?|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_255.wav|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_256.wav|However, we had no failures in our side.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_257.wav|This is his first movie.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_258.wav|The farmers had no choice in the matter.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_259.wav|They were assured that it would.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_260.wav|I'm the one who has to suffer.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_261.wav|She was charged with perjury.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_262.wav|With us, we just want them to respond.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_263.wav|But something has been lost in the translation.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_264.wav|That's the last thing they need.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_265.wav|I made a big mistake.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_266.wav|England against France is always a big game.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_267.wav|When he came to see me on Monday.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_268.wav|Government must recognise the problems of Aberdeen.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_269.wav|The criteria have changed.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_270.wav|A new school will be built.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_271.wav|Who reminded him about the score?|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_272.wav|And it had been a marvellous occasion.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_273.wav|I will not walk away from this job.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_274.wav|Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_275.wav|How do you find the youngsters?|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_276.wav|They are declining elsewhere in the UK.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_277.wav|It does not move, which is amazing.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_278.wav|We've always had a very positive attitude.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_279.wav|Part of England, is not?|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_280.wav|It may have been a cry for help.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_281.wav|There were no passengers on board.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_282.wav|Mr Forrester reacted angrily.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_283.wav|This is wrong, but that's believed.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_284.wav|They were not up to the required standard.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_285.wav|Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_286.wav|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_287.wav|Its people are inventive, talented and diligent.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_288.wav|We want to replicate that success.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_289.wav|I couldn't put my finger on it.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_290.wav|Taxation should be simplified.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_291.wav|That's a trend which will be encouraged.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_292.wav|He looked at me before replying.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_293.wav|But today was the real big one.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_294.wav|Someone else can do the cooking that night.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_295.wav|That idea is rubbish.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_296.wav|Actually, it turned out to be the concerto.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_297.wav|He planned to relocate to Scotland, probably Edinburgh.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_298.wav|After that, we made some changes.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_299.wav|It has not yet opened to pupils.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_300.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_301.wav|Almost overnight, he found his voice.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_302.wav|I want my audience to be challenged.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_303.wav|It was quite a new prescription.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_304.wav|That, too, was over two years ago.|66,,
wav48/p297/p297_305.wav|Who do you think you are?|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_306.wav|Glasgow is a tour de force.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_307.wav|I can understand the frustrations of our fans.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_308.wav|I can understand why they have gone.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_309.wav|They will give it a couple of years.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_310.wav|Your father was a good man.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_311.wav|Bob Dylan's getting old.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_312.wav|Our number one goal is prevention.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_313.wav|Mr Mason is claiming unfair dismissal.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_314.wav|And he is immensely loyal.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_315.wav|The actor has met with Mandela.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_316.wav|But there was no time for that.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_317.wav|He confirmed that there had been no warning.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_318.wav|I am not against a further inquiry.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_319.wav|The company's in good shape.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_320.wav|There are different cultures in different departments.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_321.wav|He was caught and fired.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_322.wav|I was pregnant and very worried.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_323.wav|Davis is very supportive, as a director.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_324.wav|I'll never have problems with any football managers.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_325.wav|It's only tackling congestion.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_326.wav|I came into this world with nothing.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_327.wav|You will never replace the child.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_328.wav|I'm delighted at Murray's appointment.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_329.wav|Off with their heads.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_330.wav|There will have to be a full inquiry.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_331.wav|They are now out in the cold.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_332.wav|The way ahead is not easy.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_333.wav|He intends to appeal the sentences.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_334.wav|There is no smoking gun.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_335.wav|His primary residence is Scotland.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_336.wav|It's an interesting title, Believing in Britain.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_337.wav|You are going to take away my life.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_338.wav|That was one very hard game.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_339.wav|Officers recovered a second body in the area.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_340.wav|This is the start of a slippery slope.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_341.wav|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_342.wav|Don't hold your breath.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_343.wav|The girls are ready to compete.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_344.wav|O, Is there anything in the wound?|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_345.wav|Mini rugby is a great thing.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_346.wav|It was blown out of proportion.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_347.wav|We certainly hope we have been successful.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_348.wav|Surely it can do better than that?|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_349.wav|It was all too little, too late.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_350.wav|Substantial pockets of resistance remain.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_351.wav|Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_352.wav|It is only one night, after all.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_353.wav|The professor said the results were positive.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_354.wav|Gilbert was not amused.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_355.wav|This should include procedures for personal imports.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_356.wav|The course record was in his name.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_357.wav|With him are the symbols of his faith.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_358.wav|He said he had no reports of casualties.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_359.wav|It's easy to see why.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_360.wav|The board is currently resolving its differences.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_361.wav|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_362.wav|He had lost his confidence again.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_363.wav|So, where do we go from here?|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_364.wav|I was never alone with her, right?|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_365.wav|This kind of traffic is commonplace.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_366.wav|I think we'll just keep it.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_367.wav|How is he enjoying life as a senior?|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_368.wav|It has proved a double whammy.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_369.wav|We make good weapons.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_370.wav|The vacancies are in support services and arts.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_371.wav|What has changed?|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_372.wav|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_373.wav|It's like English in its underwear.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_374.wav|I've been thinking about it for a year.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_375.wav|This is the same old story.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_376.wav|Above all the aggression must be stopped.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_377.wav|All of us in Scotland should be vigilant.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_378.wav|They finished second and third.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_379.wav|Everyone has his share of trouble.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_380.wav|You need a licence to run a pub.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_381.wav|He loved his job and working in newspapers.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_382.wav|I don't want a burial service.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_383.wav|And it's time for new leadership.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_384.wav|I'm not sure.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_385.wav|One might think that is a power.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_386.wav|We've been calling for a level playing field.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_387.wav|Smaller parties have reason to be pleased.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_388.wav|We have big ideas.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_389.wav|I hope the voters will respond.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_390.wav|And who would argue with that?|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_391.wav|I believe that gap is nearly there.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_392.wav|This is the real thing now.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_393.wav|There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_394.wav|I ran to get out of the way.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_395.wav|It was to be published next month.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_396.wav|It's not a party, no, no.|66,,
wav48/p297/p297_397.wav|We have understood the problems for some time.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_398.wav|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_399.wav|The work with Alison was a great experience.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_400.wav|She now lives in London.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_401.wav|But every country has its own character.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_402.wav|I don't have a problem with getting older.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_403.wav|In addition, it was just a breach of natural justice.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_404.wav|I played really well on the back nine.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_405.wav|Last week, he was taken into hospital.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_406.wav|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_407.wav|One policeman was killed.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_408.wav|Everything is now in place for Manchester.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_409.wav|My heart is not so sure.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_410.wav|You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_411.wav|You have to rely on each other.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_412.wav|However, it was well worth the wait.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_413.wav|It is a thing of beauty to watch.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_414.wav|However, many of their victories have been close affairs.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_415.wav|It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_416.wav|However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_417.wav|This is his personal life.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_418.wav|Now he is trying to downgrade the media.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_419.wav|Hollywood comedy is having a good week.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_420.wav|Yet the consensus is, it's worth it.|66,,,
wav48/p297/p297_421.wav|It's the tip of the iceberg.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_422.wav|It's a true story.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_423.wav|There was a substantial explosion.|66,,,,
wav48/p297/p297_424.wav|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.|66,,,
wav48/p298/p298_001.wav|Please call Stella.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_025.wav|It is bad news for the flooded areas.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_026.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_027.wav|This was the classical period of Beethoven.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_028.wav|That is just a load of baloney.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_029.wav|I was never going to play against Scotland.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_030.wav|Any error of judgment was ruled out.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_031.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_032.wav|The feeling is marvellous.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_033.wav|I think they should have more respect.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_034.wav|The crackdown is launched today by the government.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_035.wav|They are interior designers and architects.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_036.wav|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_037.wav|Others may be trying to catch up.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_038.wav|It was a crucial moment.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_039.wav|We gave everything we had.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_040.wav|I let go the telephone and ran.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_041.wav|For one thing, he was growing far too quickly.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_042.wav|His charisma is all on the course.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_043.wav|This is purely financial.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_044.wav|I will not be in dialogue with her.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_045.wav|Our dispute is with the company, not with the travelling public.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_046.wav|I did not want any damage to us.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_047.wav|It was an easy decision to come here.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_048.wav|I didn't know the company all that well, or the dancers.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_049.wav|However, you have just got to adjust to it.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_050.wav|I saw them not long after it happened.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_051.wav|This guy is never going to give up.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_052.wav|Who said impatience is a virtue?|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_053.wav|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_054.wav|You've got to have everything inside with you.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_055.wav|But it obviously doesn't, so the government needs to intervene.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_056.wav|Several hundred people attended yesterday.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_057.wav|It was more like a Labour Party rally.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_058.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_059.wav|The partnership was set up during the summer.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_060.wav|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_061.wav|The supporters gave us a lot of passion.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_062.wav|Don't say you have not been warned.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_063.wav|That is a mark of what you are.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_064.wav|Seven children had lost both parents.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_065.wav|It is par for the course, isn't it?|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_066.wav|Who, then, is going to be captain of Europe?|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_067.wav|Most people know that.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_068.wav|Some people still think she should be English.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_069.wav|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_070.wav|Repayment is not part of the game.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_071.wav|The cause of the crash was unclear.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_072.wav|What do they pay to join the club?|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_073.wav|Two people are allowed to share the duty.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_074.wav|We are now in a safe place.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_075.wav|She goes to the opening of an envelope.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_076.wav|It will be very useful for us.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_077.wav|He was obviously very genuine.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_078.wav|We just try to make great records.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_079.wav|She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_080.wav|I was unconscious for two or three seconds.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_081.wav|It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_082.wav|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_083.wav|His parenthood is called into question.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_084.wav|Audacious decisions were taken early on.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_085.wav|We really need research to help with that.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_086.wav|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_087.wav|There were no passengers on board.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_088.wav|At the time of watching, however, it is totally convincing.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_089.wav|It was his twenty-first birthday on Monday.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_090.wav|Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_091.wav|There were unconfirmed reports that it was cannabis.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_092.wav|These things are important for clubs like ourselves.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_093.wav|He didn't have time for any other hobbies.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_094.wav|Scotland were beaten again.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_095.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_096.wav|The League of Nations was also his idea.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_097.wav|I've done it almost like a variety show.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_098.wav|She is on a life support machine.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_099.wav|Their vision was not impeded.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_100.wav|Sooner rather than later, though, the healing must begin.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_101.wav|The election is total confusion and chaos.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_102.wav|Next league matches, Dundee United - Kilmarnock.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_103.wav|He went to see what he could learn.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_104.wav|It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_105.wav|Referees are easy targets.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_106.wav|The luxury has been well used.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_107.wav|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_108.wav|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_109.wav|We think all other measures are not exhausted.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_110.wav|There was no time scale.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_111.wav|Only the scale of change differed.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_112.wav|Tell you the team he picked?|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_113.wav|Winning, meanwhile, is headed back to New York City.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_114.wav|The cold war is over.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_115.wav|I'd like to take the plunge.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_116.wav|Lately, that market has come under pressure.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_117.wav|And it's more subversive.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_118.wav|We are losing this war.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_119.wav|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_120.wav|After about a year, the feeling returned to my finger.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_121.wav|They will know they deserve to be there.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_122.wav|I've got no secret.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_123.wav|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_124.wav|John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_125.wav|I asked why he had come.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_126.wav|Will they ever reopen?|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_127.wav|After that date, the numbers should stabilise or fall.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_128.wav|A lot of people were in tears.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_129.wav|We have great team spirit.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_130.wav|Above all the aggression must be stopped.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_131.wav|He loves the big occasions.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_132.wav|They should take their mobile phones.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_133.wav|He loved his job and working in newspapers.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_134.wav|We have big ideas.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_135.wav|I first met him last summer.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_136.wav|It was to be published next month.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_137.wav|Otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_138.wav|It could have been a hammering by now.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_139.wav|Subs not used, Fernandez.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_140.wav|I played really well on the back nine.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_141.wav|It's a bit like a bereavement.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_142.wav|It was tough, but we did have a lot of possession.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_143.wav|Over the last four years, we have been fairly consistent.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_144.wav|That end is enjoying life, as far as David is concerned.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_145.wav|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_146.wav|What was going through her mind that day, that night?|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_147.wav|I always knew she was funny.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_148.wav|All kinds of things occur.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_149.wav|I expected these kind of questions.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_150.wav|It was fit for royalty.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_151.wav|It is always the same, isn't it?|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_152.wav|Who would take it now, after all this?|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_153.wav|I felt really good until Friday.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_154.wav|That gives us something to kick against.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_155.wav|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.|67
wav48/p298/p298_156.wav|Equity declined to comment.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_157.wav|There is precious little middle ground.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_158.wav|She was shouting my baby, my baby.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_159.wav|The inquiry had been going on for months.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_160.wav|They were both delightful to work with.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_161.wav|It's my delight on a shiny night.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_162.wav|I'd go anywhere to work, so long as it's worth it.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_163.wav|It's now down in black and white.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_164.wav|Arsenal have plenty in the tank.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_165.wav|It is quite an eye opener.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_166.wav|Hillary plans to meet him on the summit.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_167.wav|What, they maybe have three Scottish players?|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_168.wav|Can they be serious?|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_169.wav|For athletes in our current climate, their sport is their livelihood.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_170.wav|That, in our view, is an important decision.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_171.wav|It's just that we see different things.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_172.wav|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_173.wav|We are all family men with children.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_174.wav|I think we showed that after half time.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_175.wav|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_176.wav|A wide range of restrictions are in place.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_177.wav|There was pressure from elsewhere too.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_178.wav|You let a lot of people down.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_179.wav|One person was believed to have been hit.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_180.wav|Mistakes are being made on an increasing basis.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_181.wav|We aren't going to play better.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_182.wav|They just would not have run away.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_183.wav|Two men have been charged with his murder.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_184.wav|Lifeboat is at the Tron Theatre, Glasgow, tonight.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_185.wav|The guys have really enjoyed it.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_186.wav|Charles Clarke is an idiot.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_187.wav|Our people should be immune.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_188.wav|Glasgow then took control.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_189.wav|It is simple and easy to use.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_190.wav|English rugby is on the brink of extinction, though, it's official.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_191.wav|The rear of the plane was on fire.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_192.wav|I think we finished fifth.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_193.wav|It was not a foul.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_194.wav|We know them as mobile telephones.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_195.wav|Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_196.wav|I don't know exactly what happened.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_197.wav|They were very, very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_198.wav|The Government faces a moral dilemma.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_199.wav|The pressure is on President Bush to deliver.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_200.wav|But, because of the wood, no-one had the experience.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_201.wav|It was a very difficult decision for us.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_202.wav|I am not a happy man.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_203.wav|You can be sure we will have problems.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_204.wav|Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_205.wav|I'm going with all three.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_206.wav|Most of them were one-year conscripts.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_207.wav|The line-up is a tasty one.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_208.wav|I don't honestly know how to describe it.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_209.wav|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.|67,
wav48/p298/p298_210.wav|He had taken everything from me.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_211.wav|Many, many people don't know who he is.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_212.wav|Suspension will come into force at midnight.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_213.wav|They should also have the right to vote.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_214.wav|All the teachers are Afghan refugees.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_215.wav|WHAT's in a name is this, the age of the Internet?|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_216.wav|People are so negative about the whole business.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_217.wav|They had given up on him.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_218.wav|We didn't know if people would turn up.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_219.wav|It has made me feel good.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_220.wav|You know, he was struggling with his game all week.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_221.wav|We have our supporters and our enemies.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_222.wav|She has now been registered as disabled.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_223.wav|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_224.wav|I was living with my mum.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_225.wav|It did my image a lot of good!|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_226.wav|This Government believes in parental discipline.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_227.wav|It's been a long, long journey.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_228.wav|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_229.wav|But there has never been the time, she said.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_230.wav|This could be one such case, he declared.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_231.wav|I fell in love with ballet.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_232.wav|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_233.wav|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_234.wav|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_235.wav|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_236.wav|We're still talking with a few people.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_237.wav|But one shouldn't go by that.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_238.wav|Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_239.wav|I think in three dimensions.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_240.wav|They had four children together.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_241.wav|Thames Valley police decided not to prosecute.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_242.wav|Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_243.wav|How can they engage with the work?|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_244.wav|All were later allowed home.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_245.wav|She has a wonderful mind.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_246.wav|There are just two tournaments remaining.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_247.wav|We're into that build-up now.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_248.wav|It is the end of an era.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_249.wav|We can just get on with our game.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_250.wav|But first it goes out on TV.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_251.wav|We're trying to lessen the stigma.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_252.wav|Sub Not Used, McKenzie.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_253.wav|Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_254.wav|I learned a lot from her.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_255.wav|We have reacted well to each other.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_256.wav|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_257.wav|They seem to be backing off from that.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_258.wav|They have a very good method of working.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_259.wav|Do you think you have a shot?|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_260.wav|I believe we have a good chance.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_261.wav|Things were not easy from the outset.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_262.wav|She may even appear in some more films.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_263.wav|We've had great things in the past.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_264.wav|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_265.wav|I've seen some of the submissions.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_266.wav|There is no such thing.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_267.wav|I feel very strongly about that.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_268.wav|It is a difficult thing to explain.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_269.wav|After that nothing could save him.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_270.wav|His treatment has been quite atrocious.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_271.wav|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_272.wav|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_273.wav|It is now very clear that doesn't work.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_274.wav|My dad was working in Ayrshire.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_275.wav|There are lots of these women in Finland.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_276.wav|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_277.wav|Last year, however, was a different story.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_278.wav|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_279.wav|I bought a car at auction.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_280.wav|And who were they anyway, beforehand?|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_281.wav|What is the Working Families Tax Credit?|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_282.wav|She had been sexually assaulted.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_283.wav|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_284.wav|Alcohol and nicotine are now no-go areas.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_285.wav|They are so easy for youngsters to open.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_286.wav|We have been treated with complete contempt.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_287.wav|There is no smoking gun.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_288.wav|It was rather a distorted image of Islam.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_289.wav|Mr Blair was in Washington a week later.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_290.wav|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_291.wav|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_292.wav|I have been coming here for nine years.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_293.wav|I felt under no pressure today.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_294.wav|The Devil is the creator of weapons.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_295.wav|And that was the adults.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_296.wav|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_297.wav|That is a job for the Government.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_298.wav|I felt the head was very like me.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_299.wav|And he had much need.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_300.wav|Last night the bombardment was terrible.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_301.wav|This can only help us go forward.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_302.wav|That left a bad taste in my mouth.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_303.wav|But, even so, you always want to try something new.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_304.wav|Andrew McLellan is no exception.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_305.wav|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_306.wav|Some have other commitments.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_307.wav|Last week, he was taken into hospital.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_308.wav|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_309.wav|No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_310.wav|The crowd was awesome.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_311.wav|That was moving the goalposts.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_312.wav|We have the location, which is assured.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_313.wav|Rapid revision was required.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_314.wav|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_315.wav|We couldn't go very fast.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_316.wav|Tony Blair, can you see her face?|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_317.wav|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_318.wav|We have grown up in Britain.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_319.wav|They had previously been on five-day notice.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_320.wav|I am proud of those guys.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_321.wav|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_322.wav|It is too early to speculate.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_323.wav|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_324.wav|I'll go out and be aggressive.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_325.wav|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_326.wav|What is the truth about the cow?|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_327.wav|They will want to watch a winning team.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_328.wav|Who is going to be penalised?|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_329.wav|I feel sorry for the Reds.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_330.wav|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_331.wav|Just see where the blood is coming from.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_332.wav|I have a theory.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_333.wav|In her opinion, the rich are different.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_334.wav|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_335.wav|Last year, it was ligaments in his knee.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_336.wav|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_337.wav|Sentence was deferred for background reports.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_338.wav|I'm very sad and deeply shocked.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_339.wav|Some of his family still live there.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_340.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_341.wav|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_342.wav|I get to work with very good people.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_343.wav|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_344.wav|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_345.wav|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_346.wav|I can't blame the fans for getting frustrated.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_347.wav|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_348.wav|I can appear to be nice and lovely.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_349.wav|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_350.wav|People tended to stay there for some time.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_351.wav|An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_352.wav|My preference is for the single vaccines.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_353.wav|This represents a tough game for us.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_354.wav|He saw it all as a big game.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_355.wav|The boy is no longer with us.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_356.wav|Staff should be paid for what they produce.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_357.wav|I would urge the Government to think again.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_358.wav|They were on holiday in Egypt.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_359.wav|I was happiest with my short game.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_360.wav|We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_361.wav|I'm delighted with how he has come through.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_362.wav|As if he were a High Court judge.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_363.wav|Would he be able to live with that?|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_364.wav|I'm looking at ways to do that now.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_365.wav|That kind of growth is the important thing.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_366.wav|The problems are a result of that shortfall.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_367.wav|And a film maker was born.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_368.wav|It was also put on the Internet.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_369.wav|He also has a Scottish grandfather.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_370.wav|Now that was a boxing movie.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_371.wav|Top-up fees are not on the agenda.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_372.wav|There was a battle there.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_373.wav|I might also completely change the routine.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_374.wav|Today's ruling confirms that fact.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_375.wav|It's good news and long overdue.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_376.wav|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_377.wav|I have learned a lot from him.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_378.wav|He has been campaigning for change for years.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_379.wav|I have beaten her a few times.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_380.wav|They have their own audience in Edinburgh.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_381.wav|So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_382.wav|We are being hijacked.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_383.wav|Mike Tyson went to prison.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_384.wav|She admitted the theft of letters and deception.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_385.wav|This is the first stage of catching up.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_386.wav|This is a long-term discussion paper.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_387.wav|In all cases computer equipment was seized.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_388.wav|The damage from the fire was huge.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_389.wav|Both agreed on the success of the event.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_390.wav|But we'll just keep trying to get results.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_391.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_392.wav|We have to offer value for money.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_393.wav|There will always be someone, somewhere, willing to undercut on price.|67,,
wav48/p298/p298_394.wav|However, in October another partnership was announced.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_395.wav|I am just looking to God.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_396.wav|The woman is basically off her head.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_397.wav|The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_398.wav|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_399.wav|Mr Burrell was arrested almost a year ago.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_400.wav|The South African defended his work ethic.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_401.wav|The Olympic committee should be ashamed of themselves.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_402.wav|You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.|67,,,
wav48/p298/p298_403.wav|The new work will begin in the autumn.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_404.wav|The written judgment was issued in printed form.|67,,,,
wav48/p298/p298_405.wav|He showed he has some things to learn.|67,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_001.wav|Please call Stella.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|68,,
wav48/p299/p299_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|68,,
wav48/p299/p299_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|68,,
wav48/p299/p299_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|68,,
wav48/p299/p299_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|68,,
wav48/p299/p299_025.wav|I just went for it over the weekend.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_026.wav|I managed to take her completely by surprise.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_027.wav|It is only one night, after all.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_028.wav|Gilbert was not amused.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_029.wav|My first season in Scotland was fantastic.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_030.wav|I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_031.wav|It has moved on in the last week.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_032.wav|It's easy to see why.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_033.wav|I am proud of moments like that.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_034.wav|This is a totally different order of agreement.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_035.wav|Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_036.wav|He was arrested, but later released without charge.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_037.wav|Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_038.wav|This is a big advantage.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_039.wav|I think we have a very strong case.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_040.wav|We agreed to disagree.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_041.wav|If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_042.wav|If you look at the beginning of Alien.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_043.wav|I've learned from my mistakes.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_044.wav|Today is not about contracts.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_045.wav|It should be a great game, though.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_046.wav|That says something for his strength of character.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_047.wav|You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_048.wav|It's to do with play.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_049.wav|Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_050.wav|I've just got to do this.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_051.wav|Rangers will have a massive support in Glasgow.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_052.wav|That was the problem.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_053.wav|Ministers are not involved in these discussions.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_054.wav|I have been here for only three months.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_055.wav|Everything else is second.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_056.wav|I think it is a sensible change.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_057.wav|Sex is fun?|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_058.wav|They were not doing it too well, either.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_059.wav|He added, It's not a racial problem.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_060.wav|He had played well in that central role.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_061.wav|We hope this scheme will change that.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_062.wav|It was created by genocide.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_063.wav|It was, for me, like a week in heaven.|68,,
wav48/p299/p299_064.wav|How could anyone take issue with that?|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_065.wav|He takes time out for everyone.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_066.wav|The decision is an absolute disgrace.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_067.wav|Now, just two games into the season, he has gone.|68,,
wav48/p299/p299_068.wav|A number of people could not speak English.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_069.wav|They have got off with murder.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_070.wav|They had had time for little else.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_071.wav|Both of those promises have already been honoured.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_072.wav|We have reports of this throughout Scotland.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_073.wav|It probably didn't feel anything, she added.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_074.wav|The settlement could run to millions.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_075.wav|It does not stop at the border.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_076.wav|We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_077.wav|How can they say that?|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_078.wav|Robert is a special talent.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_079.wav|John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint.|68,,
wav48/p299/p299_080.wav|She added, It is a huge problem.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_081.wav|You can't keep them separate.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_082.wav|I still feel like a wee boy.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_083.wav|He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_084.wav|But there was a shift.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_085.wav|Israel has done very little until now.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_086.wav|Debate was impassioned and furious.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_087.wav|We are losing this war.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_088.wav|A decision is expected today.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_089.wav|The death rates are still as high.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_090.wav|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_091.wav|There is a growing anger among the group.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_092.wav|We certainly will need to watch him.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_093.wav|I don't think it could be clearer.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_094.wav|He put some colour into Scottish history.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_095.wav|Our offer will remain on the table.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_096.wav|We are trying to establish a date.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_097.wav|He is a man who lives to work.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_098.wav|The website is now being amended.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_099.wav|It was a bit of a struggle today.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_100.wav|If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_101.wav|It's amazing it happened in the daytime.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_102.wav|This is thought to mean sometime next week.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_103.wav|He had a heart problem.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_104.wav|The breakdown was much later in her life.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_105.wav|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_106.wav|That was the light relief.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_107.wav|I am a wealthy person.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_108.wav|He has one son and one daughter.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_109.wav|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.|68,,
wav48/p299/p299_110.wav|That, he claimed, was essential.|68,,
wav48/p299/p299_111.wav|I have great respect for all my players.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_112.wav|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_113.wav|He had other things on his mind.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_114.wav|I hadn't seen them in eight years.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_115.wav|Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.|68,,
wav48/p299/p299_116.wav|The next few months will tell.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_117.wav|It felt like my support system was leaving.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_118.wav|It is crucial for both teams.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_119.wav|I am happy with my form.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_120.wav|You can see their point.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_121.wav|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_122.wav|They married in August last year.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_123.wav|However, in Scotland this figure was four weeks.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_124.wav|Yet he chose to do something different.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_125.wav|He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy.|68,,
wav48/p299/p299_126.wav|There were no casualties.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_127.wav|I've just got to build on this now.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_128.wav|I was pleased with my own game.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_129.wav|The case will now go to appeal.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_130.wav|They really did a great job.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_131.wav|A teacher is, really, about unity.|68,,
wav48/p299/p299_132.wav|Where is the anthrax?|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_133.wav|Bombing is the easy option.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_134.wav|I love you so very much.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_135.wav|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_136.wav|The road was closed for several hours.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_137.wav|They can be time consuming.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_138.wav|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_139.wav|I had a tie in my hand.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_140.wav|A world away from Rangers, you might say.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_141.wav|Sean Connery did not disappoint.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_142.wav|Such a city does not exist.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_143.wav|My aim is a top six finish.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_144.wav|We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_145.wav|This has a number of benefits.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_146.wav|There is too much at stake for that.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_147.wav|That is in the very nature of farming.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_148.wav|These matters are now behind us.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_149.wav|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_150.wav|Thousands of homes were left without power supplies.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_151.wav|I love the tradition of vaudeville.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_152.wav|It was then into overtime.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_153.wav|Most of the public are behind me.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_154.wav|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_155.wav|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_156.wav|I am still very much a director.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_157.wav|I might have been sitting at home, with her out here.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_158.wav|But we are severely limited in funds.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_159.wav|In some cases, the nation should be grateful.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_160.wav|Meanwhile, the problems of Ball continue to multiply.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_161.wav|My house was shaking at the time.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_162.wav|They will know they deserve to be there.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_163.wav|Of course he is.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_164.wav|This is a huge confidence boost.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_165.wav|They recorded their debut album in New York.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_166.wav|And does it?|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_167.wav|That's how it worked in Bosnia.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_168.wav|Nobody even knew it had happened.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_169.wav|Freedom from Serbia is a growing objective.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_170.wav|She is a very lucky lady.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_171.wav|Was it a foul?|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_172.wav|Jamming would be equally difficult.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_173.wav|We've been there for seven years.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_174.wav|He was as good as his word.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_175.wav|Promises were not kept.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_176.wav|My life has been destroyed.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_177.wav|His signature is his handwriting.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_178.wav|He admitted there were two aspects of fear.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_179.wav|The sense of excitement in Stirling is tangible.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_180.wav|It's not in my nature.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_181.wav|You see - this business is a good one.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_182.wav|Who is he?|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_183.wav|Serb forces then opened fire in their direction.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_184.wav|Our members are concerned about their futures.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_185.wav|It was that bad, that low.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_186.wav|It also highlighted some local hero districts.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_187.wav|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_188.wav|It worked, up to a point.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_189.wav|There was no rescue.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_190.wav|This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_191.wav|I can't stand this sort of stuff.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_192.wav|It's fun and challenging, but it is not easy.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_193.wav|NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_194.wav|Is Saddam a threat?|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_195.wav|We've got a great defensive club.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_196.wav|Darrell was, however, adamant.|68,,
wav48/p299/p299_197.wav|The rear of the plane was on fire.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_198.wav|I feel privileged to be here.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_199.wav|I'm not afraid of that.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_200.wav|If they don't, they might well decide not to play.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_201.wav|She told me to apply for the crest.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_202.wav|He explained to his audience.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_203.wav|I think the Government should pay for that.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_204.wav|I never made any offer to Mark.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_205.wav|The actors are confident and polished.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_206.wav|The budget was too low for that.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_207.wav|All inquiries should be made to the police.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_208.wav|I'm a bit annoyed.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_209.wav|On that they agree.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_210.wav|I just could not cope.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_211.wav|The outcome is now in our own hands.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_212.wav|It is all one-sided.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_213.wav|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_214.wav|Here are some possible solutions.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_215.wav|IT was a thoroughly modern affair.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_216.wav|They were both very brave.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_217.wav|He made so many bad decisions.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_218.wav|We are now up against it.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_219.wav|It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_220.wav|I would have dropped out otherwise.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_221.wav|She said No, he's not in Elgin today.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_222.wav|Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_223.wav|Mrs Anderson said this one was different.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_224.wav|But the row refused to go away.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_225.wav|Our biggest threat is the BBC.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_226.wav|Bill is a mentor.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_227.wav|They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_228.wav|This must be really short of ideas.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_229.wav|I think he has undergone a sea change.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_230.wav|I believe you may be that person.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_231.wav|It was a big day.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_232.wav|What makes a house a home?|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_233.wav|I think however, he was having a fit!|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_234.wav|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_235.wav|I will not be pressured.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_236.wav|I had another good day.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_237.wav|I hate the word.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_238.wav|We should be trying to keep him in.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_239.wav|The casting of her husband was an accident.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_240.wav|I would say so.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_241.wav|Even for a British Open, this is different.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_242.wav|I was the only one arguing differently.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_243.wav|Sub Not Used, McKay.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_244.wav|From a marketing standpoint, you can understand their concern.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_245.wav|Mind you, who wouldn't?|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_246.wav|That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_247.wav|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_248.wav|It was a tactical change.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_249.wav|She had kept the news from him.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_250.wav|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_251.wav|With this line-up, they didn't need to be.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_252.wav|We have a lot of sympathy for applicants.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_253.wav|There are so many artists working in Glasgow.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_254.wav|One of these problems is the railways.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_255.wav|Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_256.wav|We don't have the credible evidence.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_257.wav|It's one up to the Scots.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_258.wav|I'm just doing artwork.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_259.wav|He is a right bastard.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_260.wav|I don't want to use the term.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_261.wav|And we still have to pay his salary.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_262.wav|Also, he was flawed.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_263.wav|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_264.wav|So there's a double whammy.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_265.wav|I didn't have a trio.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_266.wav|Their three other children had died as infants.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_267.wav|We knew nothing about it.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_268.wav|She is a great talent.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_269.wav|I hope my successor will do the same.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_270.wav|I learned that only yesterday.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_271.wav|We do things in an appropriate way.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_272.wav|I have been totally taken aback by this.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_273.wav|Are you in this movie?|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_274.wav|We have got a full house tonight.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_275.wav|The things writers and directors say!|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_276.wav|The fans will support us.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_277.wav|Is this new report the answer?|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_278.wav|It was a long process, but we got there.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_279.wav|It has, however, been a long time coming.|68,,
wav48/p299/p299_280.wav|We need to be looking to the future.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_281.wav|The whole team was rubbish.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_282.wav|But when he left, the decision was forced upon us.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_283.wav|Some of the players have not progressed.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_284.wav|It is quite an eye opener.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_285.wav|You've got it coming Kabul.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_286.wav|They must act now to tighten the rules.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_287.wav|Quite simply, no-one else is willing to do so.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_288.wav|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_289.wav|But, mainly, it is up to ourselves.|68,,
wav48/p299/p299_290.wav|Are his works inside out?|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_291.wav|There is a cup final at stake.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_292.wav|It's the curse of our time, irony.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_293.wav|It was not a difficult decision, he said.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_294.wav|It's a source of deep concern.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_295.wav|I am not a free trader.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_296.wav|There were so many characters among them.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_297.wav|It is a very resilient and deadly bacterium.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_298.wav|However, there are also many areas of agreement.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_299.wav|Last month he made his debut in Japan.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_300.wav|The Dow Jones is way up.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_301.wav|Now there's an even bigger target.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_302.wav|They were the better side on the day.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_303.wav|No decision on that was taken.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_304.wav|What went wrong?|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_305.wav|There is nothing like a fresh start.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_306.wav|They chose to side with terror.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_307.wav|This must have been severe.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_308.wav|We're all in a state of shock.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_309.wav|I thought he was part of the camera.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_310.wav|Farmers have been an endangered species.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_311.wav|We are in a learning curve.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_312.wav|Why should we have been asked to share?|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_313.wav|He was released in March this year.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_314.wav|She was just that sort of person.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_315.wav|Surrey police said no body had been found.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_316.wav|Instead, she just went away.|68,,,

wav48/p299/p299_318.wav|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_319.wav|It was chaotic and frightening.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_320.wav|I think in three dimensions.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_321.wav|It is a question of balance.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_322.wav|Soon the whole country will be level.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_323.wav|He's very young but he is growing up.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_324.wav|The Chosen One doesn't always excel.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_325.wav|I'm not interested in coming up with answers.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_326.wav|Lambert will be playing against Belgium.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_327.wav|We could not have asked for any more.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_328.wav|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_329.wav|People might not actually want the job.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_330.wav|It is the logical extension of audio description.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_331.wav|His rival's are spoken with elan.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_332.wav|The table was compiled by the Daily Telegraph.|68,,,,

wav48/p299/p299_335.wav|He also was in debt to drug dealers.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_336.wav|The package has been properly costed.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_337.wav|I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_338.wav|We will work through the night.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_339.wav|Barry will be able to handle this.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_340.wav|This is entirely appropriate and overdue.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_341.wav|We just need the Government to act.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_342.wav|The urgency is real.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_343.wav|The criminal justice system does not do that.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_344.wav|He will never walk the streets again.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_345.wav|We're very excited and challenged by the project.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_346.wav|JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.|68,,
wav48/p299/p299_347.wav|The science is well known, the solution is simple.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_348.wav|They are just bewildered and very concerned.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_349.wav|I can't stop people thinking.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_350.wav|The workers said they were treated like animals.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_351.wav|That's the last thing he will do.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_352.wav|I have not been so angry for years.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_353.wav|I am ready for that.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_354.wav|Do you mean today?|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_355.wav|This is normal for him now.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_356.wav|But my heart is in athletics.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_357.wav|Nobody ever gets to see them.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_358.wav|A review group will report on Tuesday.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_359.wav|Yet he left a few days later.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_360.wav|The place became a war zone.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_361.wav|What's happening to her?|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_362.wav|It was to get even better for Motherwell.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_363.wav|Both parties can win, and Scotland can win as a result.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_364.wav|The surprise is its product is so poor.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_365.wav|I don't have a new house.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_366.wav|It's always nice to play on Centre Court.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_367.wav|Thus the story will continue to thrive.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_368.wav|Horses have some sense.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_369.wav|The plot is minimal.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_370.wav|See it while you can.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_371.wav|The plane was in flames|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_372.wav|But then, that really is the point.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_373.wav|One policeman was killed.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_374.wav|I didn't do too badly myself.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_375.wav|Their expressions only reflected those of the audience.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_376.wav|We have been working together for some years.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_377.wav|Chris Paterson is a class act.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_378.wav|He has never even been to Ireland.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_379.wav|And that's the question for the Chamber.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_380.wav|Do what you have to do.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_381.wav|I'm getting back up there now.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_382.wav|We believe the squad will stay together.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_383.wav|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.|68,,
wav48/p299/p299_384.wav|There is a lot of anger.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_385.wav|We suspect he was pleased.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_386.wav|It was meant to rival the dollar.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_387.wav|Mary is, as it were, the cause of her mother's death.|68,,
wav48/p299/p299_388.wav|She always wanted her own way.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_389.wav|Maybe, who knows?|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_390.wav|And the funny thing is, they usually do.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_391.wav|Everything is surrounded by confusion.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_392.wav|It was a sell-out.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_393.wav|We welcome the proposals, but they must get on with it.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_394.wav|If there is default.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_395.wav|She can't say where she was, what she did.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_396.wav|I'll take what comes along.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_397.wav|Jack McConnell is the obvious choice.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_398.wav|She will just have wanted her baby.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_399.wav|Scotland is losing business.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_400.wav|We are working on the two things.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_401.wav|We only lost the third goal.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_402.wav|Women reported more depression than men.|68,,,,
wav48/p299/p299_403.wav|We will have to see, but it makes you think.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_404.wav|The euro is your money, it is our money.|68,,,
wav48/p299/p299_405.wav|Nothing has been going for us, but what can you do?|68,,,
wav48/p300/p300_001.wav|Please call Stella.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|69,,
wav48/p300/p300_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|69,,
wav48/p300/p300_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|69,,
wav48/p300/p300_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war on heavy rain.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|69,,
wav48/p300/p300_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|69,,
wav48/p300/p300_025.wav|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_026.wav|This is not a floating Las Vegas.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_027.wav|It is not an amnesty.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_028.wav|The important thing was to be there, and to experience it.|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_029.wav|Of course, this is nice to hear.|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_030.wav|It was between myself, the management, and the team.|69,,
wav48/p300/p300_031.wav|I don't believe you own anything.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_032.wav|The music industry hasn't changed at all.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_033.wav|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_034.wav|Blood samples have been taken.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_035.wav|Someone came down and said, Can you read a script?|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_036.wav|He said he now intends to fly today.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_037.wav|This means that our programme is quite unusual.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_038.wav|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_039.wav|A further police inquiry is currently being held.|69,,,,

wav48/p300/p300_041.wav|You're not stopping people using sunbeds.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_042.wav|A recording contract is on the horizon.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_043.wav|It has been a horrible, horrible time.|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_044.wav|We like being the underdogs.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_045.wav|They said construction work could begin within weeks.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_046.wav|We will continue to operate within the sport.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_047.wav|But the law is very clear on this.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_048.wav|But all forms of the illness are treatable.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_049.wav|It is also central to the unfolding drama.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_050.wav|Except for this, it was offside.|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_051.wav|On the contrary, some of the music is very expensive.|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_052.wav|It's a grey area.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_053.wav|Retirement, who knows?|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_054.wav|He was shocked by what he saw.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_055.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_056.wav|It comes on like a tidal wave.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_057.wav|England and Wales are likely to pull out.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_058.wav|Mr Cook, a left-winger from Britain, would be ideally placed.|69,,
wav48/p300/p300_059.wav|He was taken ill in December last year.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_060.wav|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_061.wav|It's all too short term.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_062.wav|This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.|69,,
wav48/p300/p300_063.wav|Meanwhile, the weather was causing widespread disruption.|69,,,

wav48/p300/p300_304.wav|We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_305.wav|People can get them if they want.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_306.wav|Their message was simple.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_307.wav|They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_308.wav|He is a law unto himself.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_309.wav|With him are the symbols of his faith.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_310.wav|There are no easy solutions to this problem.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_311.wav|An aide was constructed to get a copy.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_312.wav|The Allies intend to maintain the average.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_313.wav|Part of Johnny was found some days after.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_314.wav|It is just completely erased.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_315.wav|A great deal has been achieved.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_316.wav|I've been thinking about it for a year.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_317.wav|I enjoy playing with both of them.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_318.wav|Too often it is not.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_319.wav|I tend not to look back.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_320.wav|Confidence among the allies began to slip.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_321.wav|I got a yellow card.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_322.wav|Technically, it was a very good performance by Scotland.|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_323.wav|I don't know what he was capable of.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_324.wav|Our place as artists is to ask questions.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_325.wav|It's good to start with Judith.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_326.wav|She is now on the back benches.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_327.wav|It may also be her last.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_328.wav|Maybe it helps us.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_329.wav|Three bystanders were killed.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_330.wav|She should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_331.wav|However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate.|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_332.wav|He made no big mistakes.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_333.wav|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_334.wav|We will be homeless.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_335.wav|I believe he can do a better job.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_336.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_337.wav|Instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_338.wav|That decision was applauded by Williamson.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_339.wav|But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_340.wav|Well, was it?|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_341.wav|We won't let you down.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_342.wav|What kind of person is he?|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_343.wav|Does it work, is it safe, and is it right?|69,,
wav48/p300/p300_344.wav|He was visited by UK consular officials.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_345.wav|So we shall remain vigilant, and keep the pressure on him.|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_346.wav|English is the language of pop music.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_347.wav|The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_348.wav|It is a simple equation.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_349.wav|She has seen, or heard, it all.|69,,
wav48/p300/p300_350.wav|Which Scot is likely to emulate his achievements?|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_351.wav|This time, however, there is a new venue.|69,,
wav48/p300/p300_352.wav|Who has the second highest?|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_354.wav|You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_355.wav|I didn't even have the first idea.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_356.wav|No person was charged.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_357.wav|I've only met him three times.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_358.wav|You see, my back has gone.|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_359.wav|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_360.wav|She looked very, very poor.|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_361.wav|Nato has completed planning for air strikes.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_362.wav|Butcher has only one idea in mind.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_363.wav|This is not great, but it goes well.|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_364.wav|It's an hour of the same response.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_365.wav|Both are national treasures.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_366.wav|And here is the rub.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_367.wav|They are also exploited by the markets.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_368.wav|Stewart will travel with some confidence.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_369.wav|I am really looking forward to it.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_370.wav|I think, at last, the company will find itself again.|69,,
wav48/p300/p300_371.wav|This takes the pressure off.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_372.wav|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_373.wav|I will never get over his death.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_374.wav|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_375.wav|We were very happy with our results, which were excellent.|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_376.wav|The mix with Tiger is perfect.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_377.wav|Well, it happened to me, so it's happening to him.|69,,
wav48/p300/p300_378.wav|Off-duty nurses were called in at Ayr.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_379.wav|They should have some measure of protection.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_380.wav|They did not threaten anyone.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_381.wav|Who is going to pay their wages?|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_382.wav|There is no hiding place in it, no room for passengers.|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_383.wav|Even then he was in the media spotlight.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_384.wav|But this is not just a Tibetan issue.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_385.wav|That's the kind of thing that counts.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_386.wav|Construction would then begin.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_387.wav|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_388.wav|A century on, little has changed.|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_389.wav|It is a temptation which should be resisted.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_390.wav|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.|69,,
wav48/p300/p300_391.wav|Form and structure are his music.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_392.wav|I don't have any bitterness about it, it's just a fact.|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_393.wav|Is the Welsh assembly going to go?|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_394.wav|The award was a lifeline for me.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_395.wav|Victory, she insisted yesterday, was far more important than the rewards.|69,,
wav48/p300/p300_396.wav|For all his successes, he is accustomed to waiting for fulfilment.|69,,,
wav48/p300/p300_397.wav|A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_398.wav|We expect to come through on Thursday.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_399.wav|Equally the employee could claim a public interest.|69,,,,
wav48/p300/p300_400.wav|Six other people were injured.|69,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_001.wav|Please call Stella.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|70,,
wav48/p301/p301_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|70,,
wav48/p301/p301_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|70,,
wav48/p301/p301_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|70,,
wav48/p301/p301_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|70,,
wav48/p301/p301_025.wav|But it was a great decision he joked.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_026.wav|They changed the world of music.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_027.wav|You need a long-term strategy in football.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_028.wav|The law has got to be upheld.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_029.wav|But we're not the same person.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_030.wav|He had just returned to Thailand from Canada.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_031.wav|I saw the explosion and panicked.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_032.wav|The punishment was swift.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_033.wav|However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_034.wav|I kept my side of the bargain.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_035.wav|It also makes for interesting viewing.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_036.wav|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.|70,,
wav48/p301/p301_037.wav|He released a half-dozen solo albums.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_038.wav|That respect is missing in the Netherlands.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_039.wav|There's always a solution, somewhere you can meet in the middle.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_040.wav|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_041.wav|It doesn't make them evil.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_042.wav|I have played really well all year.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_043.wav|Parts of the system are already overstretched.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_044.wav|Tourism in Scotland is facing a financial disaster.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_045.wav|It's like, If he's all right, we will go with him.|70,,
wav48/p301/p301_046.wav|She added, It is the same story in both countries.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_047.wav|Lara is very, very much a girl.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_048.wav|I try not to expect anything.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_049.wav|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_050.wav|There will be plenty to keep them occupied.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_051.wav|It was, however, the wrong side.|70,,
wav48/p301/p301_052.wav|She is now planning a visit.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_053.wav|It also calls for licensing of collection centres.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_054.wav|Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.|70,,
wav48/p301/p301_055.wav|Today, we begin to answer that question.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_056.wav|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.|70,,
wav48/p301/p301_057.wav|I keep my fingers crossed.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_058.wav|The encounter was to change his life.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_059.wav|It's the best of both worlds.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_060.wav|They have a way of proclaiming themselves.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_061.wav|That is why we want this decision reversed.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_062.wav|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_063.wav|Staff were invited to make their own proposals.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_064.wav|We tried everything, but it just wasn't to be today.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_065.wav|After this, the exercise was due to begin.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_066.wav|And she doesn't feel like Annika is better.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_067.wav|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_068.wav|CELTIC Connections is here again - and the great debate.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_069.wav|I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_070.wav|When he took over it really took off.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_071.wav|That's just the way the game is evolving.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_072.wav|Michael is putting on a brave face.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_073.wav|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_074.wav|The next thing will be cutting journey times.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_075.wav|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_076.wav|This is a mental challenge.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_077.wav|Their one weakness was running between the wickets.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_078.wav|He accused the Prime Minister of dithering.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_079.wav|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_080.wav|Ferguson did not hesitate.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_081.wav|He came in an army uniform.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_082.wav|However, within those figures, income from overseas visitors increased.|70,,
wav48/p301/p301_083.wav|Cars are great for going long distances.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_084.wav|It was published yesterday on the internet.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_085.wav|I knew he would play two weeks ago.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_086.wav|The general secretary, represents a new era in Labour party politics.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_087.wav|It has never been worthwhile.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_088.wav|So other options had to be explored.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_089.wav|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_090.wav|We will learn lessons from what has happened.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_091.wav|People love to see this stuff.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_092.wav|One film a year is, he says, his natural rhythm.|70,,
wav48/p301/p301_093.wav|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_094.wav|His female companion was being treated for shock.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_095.wav|I have no plans to change the oath.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_096.wav|We did not even get a free kick.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_097.wav|He was married with a young child.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_098.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.|70,,
wav48/p301/p301_099.wav|Anyone remaining after that will be targeted.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_100.wav|They serve a multitude of purposes.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_101.wav|But his attendance is not guaranteed.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_102.wav|I am sure all schools would accept that.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_103.wav|I am very sorry to be here.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_104.wav|I needed a change, a new challenge.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_105.wav|Is your life a little too easy?|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_106.wav|I think my game is suited to grass.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_107.wav|The little boy was playing football at lunchtime.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_108.wav|Industry leaders reacted angrily.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_109.wav|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_110.wav|People want to see me on the screen.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_111.wav|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_112.wav|And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_113.wav|The conversion didn't go over either.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_114.wav|He took away my childhood.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_115.wav|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_116.wav|The motive for the shooting was not known.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_117.wav|Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_118.wav|Serb forces then opened fire in their direction.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_119.wav|It is not great art.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_120.wav|You do not change overnight.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_121.wav|The way they play, it is hard to score against them.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_122.wav|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.|70,,
wav48/p301/p301_123.wav|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.|70,,
wav48/p301/p301_124.wav|We all like to see forgiveness and redemption.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_125.wav|We aim to put them out of business.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_126.wav|Tony Blair should get out more.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_127.wav|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_128.wav|He was just awesome.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_129.wav|We now have to concentrate on the league.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_130.wav|We need to move forward together.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_131.wav|She died in hospital two hours later.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_132.wav|She was making a living, but her career was going nowhere.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_133.wav|Both were later released after a check-up.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_134.wav|No-one, however, was complacent about the size of the task.|70,,
wav48/p301/p301_135.wav|How good is Lennox Lewis?|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_136.wav|I would ask the fans to be patient.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_137.wav|The ethos of the school was outstanding.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_138.wav|The son has autism and other problems.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_139.wav|I'm very puzzled by it.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_140.wav|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_141.wav|Volvo is grateful to its staff in Irvine.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_142.wav|We are both very confused and extremely angry.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_143.wav|All things are possible if you believe.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_144.wav|This was not just incongruous.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_145.wav|It is patently true.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_146.wav|You hope he prevails.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_147.wav|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_148.wav|The fellowship is much more than a commission, he said.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_149.wav|What the Department of Transport will make clear.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_150.wav|But it looks good for next year.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_151.wav|I haven't just gone in, done a three-hour rehearsal, and gone.|70,,
wav48/p301/p301_152.wav|He is wanted by German police for questioning.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_153.wav|He was forced to quit.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_154.wav|It is good for their eyesight.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_155.wav|I was loving that little girl.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_156.wav|But you can't have it both ways.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_157.wav|We don't just play golf in Scotland.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_158.wav|That's why the young musicians have joined.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_159.wav|The death toll included five children.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_160.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_161.wav|There is no credible official announcement.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_162.wav|I understand the medical concerns.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_163.wav|This is a United Kingdom.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_164.wav|I thought it was a fantastic game.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_165.wav|I am aware that somebody made a threat.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_166.wav|However, who could have predicted this result?|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_167.wav|Shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_168.wav|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_169.wav|They were behind the wheel.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_170.wav|The pressure on the aid agencies is immense.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_171.wav|The problem arises because he does so much.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_172.wav|The answer is mayhem.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_173.wav|Our young people are leaving.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_174.wav|What, then, is the real thing?|70,,
wav48/p301/p301_175.wav|I can't believe anyone would agree with it.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_176.wav|That will be the sweetness.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_177.wav|But is it ethical to practice in humans?|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_178.wav|The big issue for us is the review.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_179.wav|There was a fossil on screen.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_180.wav|I always loved the lightning in the movies.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_181.wav|This does not create any precedent.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_182.wav|I see social work as a vocation, a commitment.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_183.wav|It has removed a bit of guilt.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_184.wav|I'm just asking them to improve their disciplines.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_185.wav|You can say he gets a sizeable amount.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_186.wav|The early evidence suggests he did not.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_187.wav|Ferguson had a most productive afternoon.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_188.wav|I hope you miss the cut.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_189.wav|The role was perfect for Russell.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_190.wav|Morale is very high, despite the growing risks.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_191.wav|We are seeking funds from government departments.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_192.wav|That, though, was again according to manager McCall.|70,,
wav48/p301/p301_193.wav|He scored one goal and was on fire.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_194.wav|I hate to say it, but you can understand it.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_195.wav|Harold is a rarity.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_196.wav|Walk out the door and anything can happen.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_197.wav|I want him to take on Gomez.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_198.wav|Her condition last night was described as critical.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_199.wav|Frankly, it was worth the booking.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_200.wav|They tend to be easily influenced by others.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_201.wav|Well, what do you know?|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_202.wav|There are some serious ethical issues involved.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_203.wav|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_204.wav|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_205.wav|He will emerge as a world leader.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_206.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_207.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_208.wav|We have no choice but to shut down.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_209.wav|The prognosis is excellent.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_210.wav|They always want to give a performance.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_211.wav|But he just carried on anyway.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_212.wav|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_213.wav|I would not want to be young again.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_214.wav|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_215.wav|The Yugoslav army will still be there.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_216.wav|There are schoolboys in uniform.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_217.wav|They were later discharged from hospital.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_218.wav|These findings would be made public.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_219.wav|What are you not good at?|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_220.wav|All the lads are totally focused on that.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_221.wav|He added later, Normally, it's not a dangerous river.|70,,
wav48/p301/p301_222.wav|This makes no sense!|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_223.wav|I go home only once.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_224.wav|It had a gigantic effect.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_225.wav|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.|70,,
wav48/p301/p301_226.wav|If not, a deal could take many months.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_227.wav|The team this year is going places.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_228.wav|More money for students would help - in an ideal world.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_229.wav|It took more than two years.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_230.wav|Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_231.wav|He said because people had invited him.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_232.wav|That's the key issue isn't it?|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_233.wav|Its workforce is to be made redundant.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_234.wav|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_235.wav|Correction, knowing him, he might.|70,,
wav48/p301/p301_236.wav|I came up through the ranks.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_237.wav|Why does she suddenly win everything now?|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_238.wav|We wanted it left for a wee while.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_239.wav|These guys will not lie down.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_240.wav|The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_241.wav|That is nearly four people every day.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_242.wav|There are nine people here now.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_243.wav|His son is a local legend.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_244.wav|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.|70,,
wav48/p301/p301_245.wav|Which perhaps is just as well.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_246.wav|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_247.wav|He would just say it was terrible.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_248.wav|This is the New Edinburgh.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_249.wav|I saw military vehicles in the distance.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_250.wav|I hope it has helped the prisoners.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_251.wav|We kept going right to the final whistle.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_252.wav|For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_253.wav|JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.|70,,
wav48/p301/p301_254.wav|The final stage is paranoia.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_255.wav|I am not holding the club to ransom.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_256.wav|Wagner was never like this.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_257.wav|Pig farmers are completely despondent.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_258.wav|But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_259.wav|We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_260.wav|That's the sort of game you want.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_261.wav|We're not travel agents.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_262.wav|Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_263.wav|We are trying to clarify the issues.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_264.wav|It's the same old story.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_265.wav|He was telling me to keep quiet.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_266.wav|It was a moment of madness.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_267.wav|I do not own the vessel in question.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_268.wav|Racism has no place in any sport.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_269.wav|I am not happy with proposals for widows.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_270.wav|It is believed she had serious head injuries.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_271.wav|Bombing is the easy option.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_272.wav|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_273.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_274.wav|The pilot was making a visual approach.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_275.wav|I'd say we should give it a week.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_276.wav|Many other Scottish locations also feature.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_277.wav|Little Voice is on general release.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_278.wav|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_279.wav|There is no substitute.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_280.wav|That nation is South Africa.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_281.wav|This will secure the future of our industry.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_282.wav|The police have an awful lot to explain.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_283.wav|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_284.wav|That's when you hope to take advantage.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_285.wav|It was an empowering journey.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_286.wav|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_287.wav|It's not unlike the millennium bug.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_288.wav|They had been together for about three years.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_289.wav|Children are using books in a terrible condition.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_290.wav|Everything has been destroyed.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_291.wav|The painting was started, but finishing it was quite another matter.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_292.wav|He is married, with one daughter, and lives in Kent.|70,,
wav48/p301/p301_293.wav|We just want to get stuck in now.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_294.wav|Do you come from Moscow?|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_295.wav|Broomfield was the centre of the town.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_296.wav|He or she will oversee the leadership contest.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_297.wav|They are the innocent victims.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_298.wav|We are aware of the tribunal case.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_299.wav|That is the first job of the director - leadership.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_300.wav|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_301.wav|But he was a full, working member of our staff.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_302.wav|Broke the birdie record.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_303.wav|Either group is living in fantasy land.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_304.wav|They tried to give her advice.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_305.wav|That it is a brand name.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_306.wav|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_307.wav|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_308.wav|They will have to make changes.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_309.wav|This fact is supported by audience research.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_310.wav|Of further privacy, he had no need.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_311.wav|Both sides have to step back.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_312.wav|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_313.wav|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_314.wav|It sounds a bit of an own goal.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_315.wav|We are ready for the long haul.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_316.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_317.wav|I look for dancers who are also actors.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_318.wav|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_319.wav|EMI is a prime example.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_320.wav|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_321.wav|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_322.wav|It's a record label, not a form of music.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_323.wav|Not that Agassi was a believer.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_324.wav|A friendship that will endure.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_325.wav|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_326.wav|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_327.wav|Nowadays, it is workers united.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_328.wav|He is young but not too young.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_329.wav|I played well on Saturday and again today.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_330.wav|It will also take evidence from consumers.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_331.wav|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.|70,,
wav48/p301/p301_332.wav|I am not obsessed with sex.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_333.wav|They've been at it for five hours.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_334.wav|There is no answer to it.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_335.wav|There was no let-up for the minnows.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_336.wav|Birthdays are wonderful and terrible things.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_337.wav|His English counterpart agreed.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_338.wav|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.|70,,
wav48/p301/p301_339.wav|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_340.wav|Anyway, she is playing a lesbian.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_341.wav|I am not putting myself down.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_342.wav|He's a joy to follow.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_343.wav|Bob Dylan is getting old.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_344.wav|We were lucky to have survived.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_345.wav|Maybe we expected too much from the fixture.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_346.wav|At this level, you have all to perform well.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_347.wav|I just want to change my life.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_348.wav|He did not oppose the divorce.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_349.wav|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_350.wav|And Michael was just great.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_351.wav|He knew it would cost him millions.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_352.wav|Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_353.wav|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_354.wav|Clearly, she says, she would never resort to such devices.|70,,
wav48/p301/p301_355.wav|That only came out during a radio interview.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_356.wav|We are now setting about finding them.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_357.wav|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_358.wav|We must not go down that road.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_359.wav|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_360.wav|I am not among its admirers.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_361.wav|And that match was played in June.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_362.wav|He will address the nation this evening.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_363.wav|They have shown a great desire and attitude.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_364.wav|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_365.wav|Motherwell have no such good fortune.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_366.wav|But he is revelling in the big stage.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_367.wav|Stock markets will be watching closely.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_368.wav|If they have City backing, what is the influence?|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_369.wav|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_370.wav|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_371.wav|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_372.wav|His job was not advertised.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_373.wav|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.|70,,,,

wav48/p301/p301_375.wav|He has changed my life for ever.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_376.wav|The home was now under new management.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_377.wav|It is like a theatre of the absurd.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_378.wav|There is no openness.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_379.wav|It's being very carefully looked at.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_380.wav|It was a job he loved.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_381.wav|It may encourage more people to prospect.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_382.wav|Filtering through this material a composite finally emerges.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_383.wav|Where was their passion, the power, the feeling?|70,,
wav48/p301/p301_384.wav|It looks like paradise.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_385.wav|At the moment, it is being treated as a tragic accident.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_386.wav|We were short of athletes.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_387.wav|They want to avoid a flashpoint.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_388.wav|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_389.wav|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_390.wav|Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_391.wav|I had no qualms about it.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_392.wav|Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_393.wav|McMaster had already seen the first part.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_394.wav|It's about my time as a guitarist.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_395.wav|We have been working closely with Holyrood.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_396.wav|It was early morning.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_397.wav|Partition is not an option.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_398.wav|What other retailer would do this?|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_399.wav|This is usually done by the space shuttle.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_400.wav|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_401.wav|I won't go back to Holland.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_402.wav|In his absence, the council adopted the change.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_403.wav|There was no cohesion.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_404.wav|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.|70,,
wav48/p301/p301_405.wav|Whether this return was too soon.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_406.wav|Jackson may well be right.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_407.wav|My thoughts are with their families.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_408.wav|I saw some good things.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_409.wav|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.|70,,,,
wav48/p301/p301_410.wav|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.|70,,,
wav48/p301/p301_411.wav|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.|70,,
wav48/p302/p302_001.wav|Please call Stella.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|71,,
wav48/p302/p302_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_005.wav|She can spoon these things into her three bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|71,,
wav48/p302/p302_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|71,,
wav48/p302/p302_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the god to foretell war or heavy rain.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drop increases.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green yellow light when mixed form yellow.|71,,
wav48/p302/p302_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|71,,
wav48/p302/p302_025.wav|It does make a big difference.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_026.wav|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_027.wav|Each one has its own system.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_028.wav|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.|71,,
wav48/p302/p302_029.wav|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_030.wav|It is a very special city.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_031.wav|It has been blown out of all proportion.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_032.wav|He's not very big, either.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_033.wav|I've taken to the hills.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_034.wav|My game is in pretty good shape.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_035.wav|How come it is so often unnoticed?|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_036.wav|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_037.wav|We used to keep our business rates.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_038.wav|It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_039.wav|All of us do.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_040.wav|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_041.wav|It could have been just a quick fix.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_042.wav|We are looking for volunteers.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_043.wav|Theatre is not a museum.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_044.wav|Subs not used, McCulloch.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_045.wav|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_046.wav|He could face a jail sentence.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_047.wav|They don't take you to mass graves.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_048.wav|What's it got to do with art?|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_049.wav|Happily we found it in the library.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_050.wav|I know a lot of people who don't.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_051.wav|There was nobody on the roof.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_052.wav|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.|71,,
wav48/p302/p302_053.wav|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_054.wav|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_055.wav|The days of empty promises are over.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_056.wav|Henry was strong and talented.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_057.wav|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_058.wav|We must improve our relations with the government.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_059.wav|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_060.wav|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_061.wav|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.|71,
wav48/p302/p302_062.wav|He said it was the worst possible result.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_063.wav|The quality of life is difficult for them.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_064.wav|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_065.wav|It is just part of modern day life.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_066.wav|A young Briton had a lucky escape.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_067.wav|Treatment is not an issue with these people.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_068.wav|YOU thought it was a headache.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_069.wav|I hope we can put it behind us.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_070.wav|But it was to no avail.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_071.wav|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_072.wav|I'm thinking, what would be easier?|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_073.wav|That alibi is now gone.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_074.wav|We actually haven't managed to meet demand.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_075.wav|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_076.wav|You do have a way out.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_077.wav|It is simple, really.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_078.wav|I cannot believe she has been admonished.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_079.wav|I was in jail for five years.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_080.wav|You, the British people, are the boss.|71,,
wav48/p302/p302_081.wav|A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_082.wav|PR for Westminister is their holy grail.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_083.wav|They won the trophy in the Hoops.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_084.wav|I never won a penny throughout my career.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_085.wav|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.|71,,
wav48/p302/p302_086.wav|She could easily have been killed.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_087.wav|Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.|71,
wav48/p302/p302_088.wav|We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_089.wav|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_090.wav|The same goes for personnel.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_091.wav|He was a crazy man.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_092.wav|We don't say there wasn't a massacre.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_093.wav|That was a hard game to play in, very tough.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_094.wav|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_095.wav|There was an element of jealousy.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_096.wav|Craig is still suffering seizures.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_097.wav|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.|71,,
wav48/p302/p302_098.wav|That certainly brought me back down to earth.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_099.wav|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_100.wav|We have no idea what caused the derailment.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_101.wav|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_102.wav|Does it feel like the ideas and emotions?|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_103.wav|He is only now regaining his confidence.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_104.wav|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_105.wav|It separates the men from the boys.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_106.wav|But the attachment took a lot of growing.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_107.wav|You'll get on like a house on fire.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_108.wav|Two and a half million people have died.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_109.wav|Or so it would appear.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_110.wav|I hope they understand that.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_111.wav|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_112.wav|She will also get a pay rise.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_114.wav|It is time for a more honest approach.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_115.wav|The move is considered a major breakthrough.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_116.wav|I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_117.wav|I want to play at the highest level.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_118.wav|Stalkers are capable of killing.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_119.wav|It ignores the future.|71,,,,

wav48/p302/p302_121.wav|The trial is set for February.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_122.wav|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_123.wav|Do not go into government buildings.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_124.wav|There is only one caveat.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_125.wav|We are still getting signals.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_126.wav|And perhaps it is as simple as that.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_127.wav|They prefer the short, intensive session.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_128.wav|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_129.wav|The New Deal will constantly be improved.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_130.wav|THE headless man has finally developed a face.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_131.wav|I heard some of his remarks.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_132.wav|Mary Archer is almost too clever.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_133.wav|I was just overwhelmed.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_134.wav|It has been in place since last July.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_135.wav|The European Court is our only option.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_136.wav|Do you think they would be any better?|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_137.wav|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_138.wav|Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_139.wav|The singer's condition was not specified.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_140.wav|How much of a cop out is that?|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_141.wav|The whole region is in shock.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_142.wav|It will be the final push.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_143.wav|Lord Levy said he'd started his life with nothing.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_144.wav|You were the kidnappers.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_145.wav|It is a very interesting subject.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_146.wav|The women were on their way home yesterday.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_147.wav|I could feel the blood on my face.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_148.wav|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_149.wav|Well, it's not before time, is it?|71,,
wav48/p302/p302_150.wav|Debbie Harry was cool.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_151.wav|Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_152.wav|That sort of thing is long gone.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_153.wav|I'm afraid to say anything.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_154.wav|I know you went back this morning.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_155.wav|We did not want an absentee landlord.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_156.wav|These men could be anywhere in the world.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_157.wav|Smaller parties have reason to be pleased.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_158.wav|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.|71,,,,

wav48/p302/p302_161.wav|He will make an excellent chief inspector.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_162.wav|The red card was okay.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_163.wav|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.|71,,
wav48/p302/p302_164.wav|But they will not be compelled to join.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_165.wav|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_166.wav|I was doing well at the hustings.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_167.wav|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_168.wav|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_169.wav|We must put a marker down.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_170.wav|But she's also beautiful behind the face.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_171.wav|There is no date on this document.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_172.wav|And now he tells us.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_173.wav|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.|71,,
wav48/p302/p302_174.wav|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.|71,,
wav48/p302/p302_175.wav|It is time to come into the limelight.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_176.wav|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_177.wav|His name is Michael Owen.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_179.wav|I will have to order its destruction.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_180.wav|I foolishly had done nothing about it.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_181.wav|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_182.wav|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_183.wav|Smith has not let him down.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_184.wav|No, it's actually in a block of flats.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_185.wav|Reviving the Scottish Open is one option.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_186.wav|They have two children.|71,,,,

wav48/p302/p302_191.wav|It's amazing it happened in daytime.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_192.wav|I felt we had fallen back a little.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_193.wav|Scottish fishermen comended the decision.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_194.wav|Or so we have long assumed.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_195.wav|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_196.wav|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_197.wav|It's not just for classical music.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_198.wav|This must be kept in total perspective.|71,,,,

wav48/p302/p302_200.wav|They had not been handcuffed.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_201.wav|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_202.wav|I've never been limited on drugs.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_203.wav|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.|71,,,

wav48/p302/p302_205.wav|We have chosen for the patients.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_206.wav|He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_207.wav|Why should we even be asked to share?|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_208.wav|Which means it matters.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_209.wav|There is a great potential on this river.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_210.wav|I was surprised by his response.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_211.wav|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_212.wav|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_213.wav|Officials say the city must achieve this.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_214.wav|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_215.wav|Is this accurate?|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_216.wav|A judicial review is also being considered.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_217.wav|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_218.wav|They could go no further forward.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_219.wav|I don't know why you say goodbye.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_220.wav|Appointed general secretary last September.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_221.wav|They make it look very easy.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_222.wav|It was a total surprise.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_223.wav|I had enough on.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_224.wav|And we're not there yet.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_225.wav|No meaningful response was issued.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_226.wav|It is a form of physical exercise.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_227.wav|plays in dark blue.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_228.wav|But, by that time, of course, it is again.|71,
wav48/p302/p302_229.wav|It is something that we will put right.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_230.wav|Survival is our aim.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_231.wav|There is no reason at all.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_232.wav|This is her first senior Scottish selection.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_233.wav|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_234.wav|I'm pleased with the horse.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_235.wav|But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_236.wav|This is a club on the rise.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_237.wav|I had a sense of deja vu.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_238.wav|His silence on the issue is interesting.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_239.wav|They follow him everywhere.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_240.wav|I couldn't make out what was going on.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_241.wav|There was no safety net.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_242.wav|So we said, no, we're not going to do that.|71,,
wav48/p302/p302_243.wav|I had a choice, and didn't have to do that.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_244.wav|I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_245.wav|Mr Miller is married with three children.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_246.wav|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_247.wav|We have great sympathy with Danny.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_248.wav|He should be a great asset.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_249.wav|It means they actually control the programme.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_250.wav|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?|71,,
wav48/p302/p302_251.wav|We are not out of touch with politics.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_252.wav|We could have got three medals.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_253.wav|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_254.wav|We are at a crossroads.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_255.wav|We are satisfied with this outcome.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_257.wav|It didn't take long.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_258.wav|This meeting is the path to salvation.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_259.wav|Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_260.wav|I started on a fire a couple of times.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_261.wav|He also received a medal of honour.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_262.wav|It's not one for the purists.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_263.wav|She said he showed no remorse.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_264.wav|I'm a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.|71,,
wav48/p302/p302_265.wav|We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_266.wav|It is a time bomb.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_267.wav|It's a matter of huge concern.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_268.wav|Harrowing is easy, after all.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_269.wav|Three years probation is just a joke.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_270.wav|The outstanding issues are still there.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_271.wav|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_272.wav|I'm not sure how they got there, but they are.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_274.wav|He always has been, since his early days with Scottish Opera.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_275.wav|That got me out of jail.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_276.wav|We have turned the corner.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_277.wav|This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.|71,,
wav48/p302/p302_278.wav|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_279.wav|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.|71,,
wav48/p302/p302_280.wav|However, the move was bitterly criticised last night.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_281.wav|We have taken steps to rectify it.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_282.wav|I see no need for change.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_283.wav|Do yourselves a favour.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_284.wav|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_285.wav|Others said they had been beaten by police.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_286.wav|The new system will be marketed this summer.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_287.wav|I'd love to be like Peter.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_288.wav|They came into collision with Sergio.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_289.wav|We also hope to meet the Ulster Unionists.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_290.wav|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_291.wav|He is a success story by any standard.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_292.wav|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_293.wav|I shall be voting Yes to support him.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_294.wav|Is something which we just don't do.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_295.wav|We work on the same level.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_296.wav|I've got a young family.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_297.wav|I'm trying to stay open on that.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_298.wav|It all seemed so easy.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_299.wav|I really don't understand what is happening.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_300.wav|The frustration was showing.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_301.wav|Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_302.wav|I am a wealthy person.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_303.wav|My friends were very envious.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_304.wav|The snipers are also out.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_305.wav|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_306.wav|We are determined to establish the facts.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_307.wav|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_308.wav|The list is too long for this piece.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_309.wav|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_310.wav|Entries for the event are still being accepted.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_311.wav|It plans to return to this field.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_312.wav|However, there was no hope, and glory too, for Scotland.|71,
wav48/p302/p302_313.wav|To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.|71,,,
wav48/p302/p302_314.wav|Tonight's matches European Championship.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_315.wav|It's like the Russians.|71,,,,
wav48/p302/p302_316.wav|Is that Titanic?|71,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_001.wav|Please call Stella.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|72,,
wav48/p303/p303_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|72,,
wav48/p303/p303_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|72,,
wav48/p303/p303_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_015.wav|The Greeks used it to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|72,,
wav48/p303/p303_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|72,,
wav48/p303/p303_025.wav|It is bad news for the flooded areas.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_026.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_027.wav|This was the classical period of Beethoven.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_028.wav|That is just a load of baloney.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_029.wav|I was never going to play against Scotland.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_030.wav|Any error of judgment was ruled out.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_031.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_032.wav|The feeling is marvellous.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_033.wav|I think they should have more respect.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_034.wav|The crackdown is launched today by the government.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_035.wav|They are interior designers and architects.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_036.wav|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_037.wav|Others may be trying to catch up.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_038.wav|It was a crucial moment.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_039.wav|We gave everything we had.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_040.wav|I let go the telephone and ran.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_041.wav|For one thing, he was growing far too quickly.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_042.wav|His charisma is all on the course.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_043.wav|This is purely financial.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_044.wav|I will not be in dialogue with her.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_045.wav|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_046.wav|I did not want any damage to us.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_047.wav|It was an easy decision to come here.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_048.wav|I didn't know the company all that well, or the dancers.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_049.wav|However, you have just got to adjust to it.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_050.wav|I saw them not long after it happened.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_051.wav|This guy is never going to give up.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_052.wav|Who said impatience is a virtue?|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_053.wav|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.|72,,
wav48/p303/p303_054.wav|You've got to have everything inside with you.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_055.wav|But it obviously doesn't, so the government needs to intervene.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_056.wav|Several hundred people attended yesterday.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_057.wav|It was more like a Labour Party rally.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_058.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_059.wav|The partnership was set up during the summer.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_060.wav|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_061.wav|The supporters gave us a lot of passion.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_062.wav|Don't say you have not been warned.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_063.wav|That is a mark of what you are.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_064.wav|Seven children had lost both parents.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_065.wav|It is par for the course, isn't it?|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_066.wav|Who, then, is going to be captain of Europe?|72,,
wav48/p303/p303_067.wav|Most people know that.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_068.wav|Some people still think she should be English.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_069.wav|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_070.wav|Repayment is not part of the game.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_071.wav|The cause of the crash was unclear.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_072.wav|What do they pay to join the club?|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_073.wav|Two people are allowed to share the duty.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_074.wav|We are now in a safe place.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_075.wav|She goes to the opening of an envelope.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_076.wav|It will be very useful for us.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_077.wav|He was obviously very genuine.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_078.wav|We just try to make great records.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_079.wav|She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_080.wav|I was unconscious for two or three seconds.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_081.wav|It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.|72,,
wav48/p303/p303_082.wav|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_083.wav|His parenthood is called into question.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_084.wav|Audacious decisions were taken early on.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_085.wav|We really need research to help with that.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_086.wav|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_087.wav|There were no passengers on board.|72,,,,

wav48/p303/p303_092.wav|These things are important for clubs like ourselves.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_093.wav|He didn't have time for any other hobbies.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_094.wav|Scotland were beaten again.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_095.wav|The Premier League has been a huge success.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_096.wav|The League of Nations was also his idea.|72,,,,

wav48/p303/p303_098.wav|She is on a life support machine.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_099.wav|Their vision was not impeded.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_100.wav|Sooner rather than later, though, the healing must begin.|72,,
wav48/p303/p303_101.wav|The election is total confusion and chaos.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_102.wav|Next league matches, Dundee United - Kilmarnock.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_103.wav|He went to see what he could learn.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_104.wav|It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_105.wav|Referees are easy targets.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_106.wav|The luxury has been well used.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_107.wav|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_108.wav|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.|72,,
wav48/p303/p303_109.wav|We think all other measures are not exhausted.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_110.wav|There was no time scale.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_111.wav|Only the scale of change differed.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_112.wav|Tell you the team he picked?|72,,,,

wav48/p303/p303_114.wav|The cold war is over.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_115.wav|I'd like to take the plunge.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_116.wav|Lately, that market has come under pressure.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_117.wav|And it's more subversive.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_118.wav|We are losing this war.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_119.wav|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_120.wav|After about a year, the feeling returned to my finger.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_121.wav|They will know they deserve to be there.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_122.wav|I've got no secret.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_123.wav|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_124.wav|John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.|72,,
wav48/p303/p303_125.wav|I asked why he had come.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_126.wav|Will they ever reopen?|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_127.wav|After that date, the numbers should stabilise or fall.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_128.wav|A lot of people were in tears.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_129.wav|We have great team spirit.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_130.wav|Above all the aggression must be stopped.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_131.wav|He loves the big occasions.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_132.wav|They should take their mobile phones.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_133.wav|He loved his job and working in newspapers.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_134.wav|We have big ideas.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_135.wav|I first met him last summer.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_136.wav|It was to be published next month.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_137.wav|Otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_138.wav|It could have been a hammering by now.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_139.wav|Subs not used, Fernandez.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_140.wav|I played really well on the back nine.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_141.wav|It's a bit like a bereavement.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_142.wav|It was tough, but we did have a lot of possession.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_143.wav|Over the last four years, we have been fairly consistent.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_144.wav|That end is enjoying life, as far as David is concerned.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_145.wav|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.|72,,
wav48/p303/p303_146.wav|What was going through her mind that day, that night?|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_147.wav|I always knew she was funny.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_148.wav|All kinds of things occur.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_149.wav|I expected these kind of questions.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_150.wav|It was fit for royalty.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_151.wav|It is always the same, isn't it?|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_152.wav|Who would take it now, after all this?|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_153.wav|I felt really good until Friday.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_154.wav|That gives us something to kick against.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_155.wav|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.|72
wav48/p303/p303_156.wav|Equity declined to comment.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_157.wav|There is precious little middle ground.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_158.wav|She was shouting my baby, my baby.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_159.wav|The inquiry had been going on for months.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_160.wav|They were both delightful to work with.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_161.wav|It's my delight on a shiny night.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_162.wav|I'd go anywhere to work, so long as it's worth it.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_163.wav|It's now down in black and white.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_164.wav|Arsenal have plenty in the tank.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_165.wav|It is quite an eye opener.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_166.wav|Hillary plans to meet him on the summit.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_167.wav|What, they maybe have three Scottish players?|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_168.wav|Can they be serious?|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_169.wav|For athletes in our current climate, their sport is their livelihood.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_170.wav|That, in our view, is an important decision.|72,,
wav48/p303/p303_171.wav|It's just that we see different things.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_172.wav|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_173.wav|We're all family men with children.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_174.wav|I think we showed that after half time.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_175.wav|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.|72,,
wav48/p303/p303_176.wav|A wide range of restrictions are in place.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_177.wav|There was pressure from elsewhere too.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_178.wav|You let a lot of people down.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_179.wav|One person was believed to have been hit.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_180.wav|Mistakes are being made on an increasing basis.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_181.wav|We aren't going to play better.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_182.wav|They just would not have run away.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_183.wav|Two men have been charged with his murder.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_184.wav|Lifeboat is at the Tron Theatre, Glasgow, tonight.|72,,
wav48/p303/p303_185.wav|The guys have really enjoyed it.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_186.wav|Charles Clarke is an idiot.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_187.wav|Our people should be immune.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_188.wav|Glasgow then took control.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_189.wav|It is simple and easy to use.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_190.wav|English rugby is on the brink of extinction, though, it's official.|72,,
wav48/p303/p303_191.wav|The rear of the plane was on fire.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_192.wav|I think we finished fifth.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_193.wav|It was not a foul.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_194.wav|We know them as mobile telephones.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_195.wav|Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_196.wav|I don't know exactly what happened.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_197.wav|They were very, very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_198.wav|The Government faces a moral dilemma.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_199.wav|The pressure is on President Bush to deliver.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_200.wav|But, because of the wood, no-one had the experience.|72,,
wav48/p303/p303_201.wav|It was a very difficult decision for us.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_202.wav|I am not a happy man.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_203.wav|You can be sure we will have problems.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_204.wav|Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_205.wav|I'm going with all three.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_206.wav|Most of them were one-year conscripts.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_207.wav|The line-up is a tasty one.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_208.wav|I don't honestly know how to describe it.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_209.wav|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.|72,
wav48/p303/p303_210.wav|He had taken everything from me.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_211.wav|Many, many people don't know who he is.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_212.wav|Suspension will come into force at midnight.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_213.wav|They should also have the right to vote.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_214.wav|All the teachers are Afghan refugees.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_215.wav|WHAT's in a name in this, the age of the Internet?|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_216.wav|People are so negative about the whole business.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_217.wav|They had given up on him.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_218.wav|We didn't know if people would turn up.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_219.wav|It has made me feel good.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_220.wav|You know, he was struggling with his game all week.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_221.wav|We have our supporters and our enemies.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_222.wav|She has now been registered as disabled.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_223.wav|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.|72,,
wav48/p303/p303_224.wav|I was living with my mum.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_225.wav|It did my image a lot of good!|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_226.wav|This Government believes in parental discipline.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_227.wav|It's been a long, long journey.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_228.wav|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_229.wav|But there has never been the time, she said.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_230.wav|This could be one such case, he declared.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_231.wav|I fell in love with ballet.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_232.wav|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_233.wav|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.|72,,
wav48/p303/p303_234.wav|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.|72,,
wav48/p303/p303_235.wav|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_236.wav|We're still talking with a few people.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_237.wav|But one shouldn't go by that.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_238.wav|Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_239.wav|I think in three dimensions.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_240.wav|They had four children together.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_241.wav|Thames Valley police decided not to prosecute.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_242.wav|Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.|72,,
wav48/p303/p303_243.wav|How can they engage with the work?|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_244.wav|All were later allowed home.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_245.wav|She has a wonderful mind.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_246.wav|There are just two tournaments remaining.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_247.wav|We're into that build-up now.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_248.wav|It is the end of an era.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_249.wav|We can just get on with our game.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_250.wav|But first it goes out on TV.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_251.wav|We're trying to lessen the stigma.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_252.wav|Sub Not Used, McKenzie.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_253.wav|Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_254.wav|I learned a lot from her.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_255.wav|We have reacted well to each other.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_256.wav|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.|72,,
wav48/p303/p303_257.wav|They seem to be backing off from that.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_258.wav|They have a very good method of working.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_259.wav|Do you think you have a shot?|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_260.wav|I believe we have a good chance.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_261.wav|Things were not easy from the outset.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_262.wav|She may even appear in some more films.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_263.wav|We've had great things in the past.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_264.wav|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_265.wav|I've seen some of the submissions.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_266.wav|There is no such thing.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_267.wav|I feel very strongly about that.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_268.wav|It is a difficult thing to explain.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_269.wav|After that nothing could save him.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_270.wav|His treatment has been quite atrocious.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_271.wav|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_272.wav|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_273.wav|It is now very clear that that doesn't work.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_274.wav|My dad was working in Ayrshire.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_275.wav|There are lots of these women in Finland.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_276.wav|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_277.wav|Last year, however, was a different story.|72,,
wav48/p303/p303_278.wav|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_279.wav|I bought a car at auction.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_280.wav|And who were they anyway, beforehand?|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_281.wav|What is the Working Families Tax Credit?|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_282.wav|She had been sexually assaulted.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_283.wav|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_284.wav|Alcohol and nicotine are now no-go areas.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_285.wav|They are so easy for youngsters to open.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_286.wav|We have been treated with complete contempt.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_287.wav|There is no smoking gun.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_288.wav|It was rather a distorted image of Islam.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_289.wav|Mr Blair was in Washington a week later.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_290.wav|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_291.wav|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_292.wav|I have been coming here for nine years.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_293.wav|I felt under no pressure today.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_294.wav|The Devil is the creator of weapons.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_295.wav|And that was the adults.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_296.wav|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.|72,,
wav48/p303/p303_297.wav|That is a job for the Government.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_298.wav|I felt the head was very like me.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_299.wav|And he had much need.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_300.wav|Last night the bombardment was terrible.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_301.wav|This can only help us go forward.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_302.wav|That left a bad taste in my mouth.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_304.wav|Andrew McLellan is no exception.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_305.wav|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_306.wav|Some have other commitments.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_307.wav|Last week, he was taken into hospital.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_308.wav|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_309.wav|No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.|72,,
wav48/p303/p303_310.wav|The crowd was awesome.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_311.wav|That was moving the goalposts.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_312.wav|We have the location, which is assured.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_313.wav|Rapid revision was required.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_314.wav|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?|72,,
wav48/p303/p303_315.wav|We couldn't go very fast.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_316.wav|Tony Blair, can you see her face?|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_317.wav|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_318.wav|We have grown up in Britain.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_319.wav|They had previously been on five-day notice.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_320.wav|I am proud of those guys.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_321.wav|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.|72,,
wav48/p303/p303_322.wav|It is too early to speculate.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_323.wav|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.|72,,
wav48/p303/p303_324.wav|I'll go out and be aggressive.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_325.wav|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.|72,,
wav48/p303/p303_326.wav|What is the truth about the cow?|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_327.wav|They will want to watch a winning team.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_328.wav|Who is going to be penalised?|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_329.wav|I feel sorry for the Reds.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_330.wav|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.|72,,
wav48/p303/p303_331.wav|Just see where the blood is coming from.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_332.wav|I have a theory.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_333.wav|In her opinion, the rich are different.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_334.wav|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_335.wav|Last year, it was ligaments in his knee.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_336.wav|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_337.wav|Sentence was deferred for background reports.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_338.wav|I'm very sad and deeply shocked.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_339.wav|Some of his family still live there.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_340.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_341.wav|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_342.wav|I get to work with very good people.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_343.wav|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_344.wav|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_345.wav|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_346.wav|I can't blame the fans for getting frustrated.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_347.wav|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.|72,,,
wav48/p303/p303_348.wav|I can appear to be nice and lovely.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_349.wav|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_350.wav|People tended to stay there for some time.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_351.wav|An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_352.wav|My preference is for the single vaccines.|72,,,,
wav48/p303/p303_353.wav|This represents a tough game for us.|72,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_001.wav|Please call Stella.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|73,,
wav48/p304/p304_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|73,,
wav48/p304/p304_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|73,,
wav48/p304/p304_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|73,,
wav48/p304/p304_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|73,,
wav48/p304/p304_025.wav|So we will cut their numbers.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_026.wav|Who cares about that?|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_027.wav|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_028.wav|Glasgow is going to be open for business.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_029.wav|I know my job.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_030.wav|The likelihood is that it will be negative.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_031.wav|In fact, we were all over the shop.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_032.wav|Scottish rugby has given me everything.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_033.wav|They agree to meet.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_034.wav|SOMETIMES, it's not what you say that counts.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_035.wav|But there was a heavy price to pay.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_036.wav|The most important thing was to win today.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_037.wav|We have a strong team at the moment.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_038.wav|At half-time you have?|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_039.wav|The butcher is very good.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_040.wav|He is dying from cancer.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_041.wav|However, they will only be found in the wild.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_042.wav|It was an ambush.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_043.wav|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_044.wav|Scottish sport was not mentioned.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_045.wav|I was doing a charity concert.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_046.wav|You have to have a sense of humour.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_047.wav|It is not about changing our image.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_048.wav|We are waiting for advice on the film.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_049.wav|I hadn't been looking after myself.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_050.wav|His father said, My son was lucky.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_051.wav|But they also came with a downside.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_052.wav|She was only doing her job.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_053.wav|Are you listening, All Saints?|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_054.wav|And then came the seventies.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_055.wav|I guess it is down to focus.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_056.wav|I'm very angry about it.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_057.wav|I have great respect for all my players.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_058.wav|His track record is not promising.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_059.wav|For a moment it was all about her.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_060.wav|Sadly, the game will never see his like again.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_061.wav|Trading Places was too obvious.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_062.wav|They don't know how to do it.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_063.wav|No details were disclosed.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_064.wav|Mrs Anderson said this one was different.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_065.wav|If you can get away with it, you do it.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_066.wav|First is open defiance.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_067.wav|You probably have never seen them before.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_068.wav|Clearly, audiences are unsettled.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_069.wav|We have avoided that at least.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_070.wav|I love a clever reader.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_071.wav|I do not believe they are.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_072.wav|That is completely against Islam.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_073.wav|Clearly, there will have to be changes.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_074.wav|Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_075.wav|I will wait until later.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_076.wav|But, of course, it isn't.|73,,
wav48/p304/p304_077.wav|We are almost at that point, but not quite.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_078.wav|Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_079.wav|Could it be?|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_080.wav|It is bad news for us and England.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_081.wav|They had failed to explode.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_082.wav|We're all involved in deciding where it goes.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_083.wav|I am happy to play for Aberdeen.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_084.wav|Nor should there have been.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_085.wav|Smoking is also very important.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_086.wav|I have a theory.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_087.wav|He was determined to write a novel.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_088.wav|So is there anything left to say?|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_089.wav|My back is feeling really good.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_090.wav|They've got their own agenda.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_091.wav|This commitment should be built upon.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_092.wav|It was one he was born to play.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_093.wav|But we are losing that connection.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_094.wav|He was jailed for five years.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_095.wav|I am about protecting the state pension.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_096.wav|We will look into it.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_097.wav|But he's not afraid to take risks.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_098.wav|We shouldn't have a rush to judgment.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_099.wav|I live on the streets of Glasgow.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_100.wav|Did you get the script?|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_101.wav|This is an exciting time in Scottish politics.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_102.wav|There, you were just a body.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_103.wav|He will suspend it on Thursday afternoon.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_104.wav|Four people died instantly.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_105.wav|He did not know his daughter.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_106.wav|Jim Wallace has been running the Government.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_107.wav|Our children are the future of our society.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_108.wav|Nine other passengers were treated at the scene.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_109.wav|I can't believe it's all gone.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_110.wav|I am just going to go for it.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_111.wav|We will meet again.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_112.wav|We are about to have our own Parliament.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_113.wav|Part of the complex is historic.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_114.wav|We need to chat.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_115.wav|Justice was not seen today.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_116.wav|Among them are many criminals.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_117.wav|This is not about revenge.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_118.wav|How can we ignore it?|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_119.wav|It's totally double standards.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_120.wav|Strikers like to go to the ground.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_121.wav|It's something he works hard at achieving.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_122.wav|We are taking the back seat on this.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_123.wav|It was a privilege to work for him.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_124.wav|But he admits he is deeply upset.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_125.wav|We told them in August.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_126.wav|We are going to have a parade.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_127.wav|That could be at least five years away.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_128.wav|That is my role.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_129.wav|Everyone can be bought.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_130.wav|You would be a fool not to listen.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_131.wav|No other offers apply.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_132.wav|Have you noticed?|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_133.wav|This is a wonderful honour for me.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_134.wav|The Lobby is not failing.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_135.wav|It was a takeover.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_136.wav|That statement has never been withdrawn.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_137.wav|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_138.wav|How many cases have there been?|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_139.wav|But we have to plan for the future.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_140.wav|And yet his legacy is doubtful.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_141.wav|This advice was accepted by ministers.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_142.wav|That's a pretty good percentage.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_143.wav|I feel very sad and extremely cut up.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_144.wav|I can't remember a lot about the accident.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_145.wav|You have to think not.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_146.wav|This is a total mystery.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_147.wav|They were due to have begun today.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_148.wav|Do not listen to them.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_149.wav|So what makes it so special?|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_150.wav|It will be easier for us.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_151.wav|I'm pleased for him.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_152.wav|The report will be launched in Glasgow today.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_153.wav|You need a trademark.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_154.wav|This is our Olympics.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_155.wav|Things are looking pretty positive at the moment.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_156.wav|The tournament has now been cancelled.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_157.wav|My goal was very important to the team.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_158.wav|There are plenty examples.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_159.wav|This is not a Scottish problem.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_160.wav|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_161.wav|I have worked with him on projects.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_162.wav|It may be that lifestyle is behind it.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_163.wav|It was nice to get a clean sheet.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_164.wav|And there is no cause for it.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_165.wav|I really couldn't believe it had actually happened.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_166.wav|What has changed?|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_167.wav|Manchester United were still trying up to yesterday.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_168.wav|It is a symbolic concert.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_169.wav|He asked me how they were doing.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_170.wav|They would have looked out for each other.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_171.wav|I've got three other ideas for the day.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_172.wav|Well it had to be something, that's for sure.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_174.wav|On Saturday, it was much the same.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_175.wav|I think that's a bit of an invasion.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_176.wav|The result today is an impasse.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_177.wav|Nelson does not disappoint.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_178.wav|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_179.wav|The real world is full of competing causes.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_180.wav|They've got to decide to do that.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_181.wav|Strathclyde Police declined to comment.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_182.wav|These are terrible offences.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_183.wav|This is it finally finished.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_184.wav|An announcement is expected today on their future.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_185.wav|There were so many characters among them.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_186.wav|Or is it the European approach?|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_187.wav|We could not get any possession.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_188.wav|Did you see that?|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_189.wav|The cost of war is more than that.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_190.wav|I saw the whole thing.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_191.wav|There is a demand for another hospice.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_192.wav|There is a contract in existence for Allan.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_193.wav|Then they were awarded a penalty.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_194.wav|Journalists should make him.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_195.wav|They will have five minutes to decide.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_196.wav|I see that any day now.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_197.wav|But who knows?|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_198.wav|He was tough and relentless.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_199.wav|That would be unlawful.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_200.wav|This guy is amazing.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_201.wav|The same goes for McKenna.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_202.wav|That is no use.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_203.wav|They will want to perform well.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_204.wav|We should not worry about other players.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_205.wav|Ownership was the game.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_206.wav|Their moment had come, or so they said.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_207.wav|I love the moment of being first.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_208.wav|Some examples are presented in detail.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_209.wav|You cannot understand it until you experience it.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_210.wav|Anything that can be done, the Government will do.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_211.wav|I sincerely hope that will not change.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_212.wav|Just don't go looking to be shocked.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_213.wav|It was total confusion.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_214.wav|I have learned from him.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_215.wav|Pupils will be the losers.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_216.wav|The position on the euro remains unchanged.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_217.wav|Such actions are rarely popular.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_218.wav|That is why it is so lyrical.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_219.wav|It isn't a happy memory.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_220.wav|A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_221.wav|Who would be a referee?|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_222.wav|We have a team to reach the final.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_223.wav|We want to be separate from our neighbours.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_224.wav|He was correct in everything he did.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_225.wav|I see no reason for them to be.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_226.wav|I never agreed with that.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_227.wav|He was dead on arrival at the hospital.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_228.wav|I don't think it is vital.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_229.wav|But he insisted that victory was possible.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_230.wav|That could run into millions.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_231.wav|It might not survive the process.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_232.wav|The truth is, it is somewhere in the middle.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_233.wav|I'm really excited about the album.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_234.wav|We were desperate to get the game on.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_235.wav|But there is a possible place.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_236.wav|You can't have it both ways.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_237.wav|Offered the gold medal, he declined.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_238.wav|But they will need to play to score.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_239.wav|He is a joy to watch.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_240.wav|They also have good neighbours.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_241.wav|We are now open.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_242.wav|She said she would not welcome the flowers.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_243.wav|There is no pressure from anyone now.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_244.wav|Now it has become a big picture.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_245.wav|We want to learn lessons from that.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_246.wav|He can perform well under pressure.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_247.wav|I've enjoyed the whole experience.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_248.wav|He was totally without that form of fear.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_249.wav|The band was good, and it's been a great day.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_250.wav|ALL IS busy but not much is happening.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_251.wav|They have the cash to do that.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_252.wav|This is a defining moment in this parliament.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_253.wav|He wouldn't have played in all three.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_254.wav|And that includes the Barnett formula.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_255.wav|It is a great shame.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_256.wav|But experts have disputed that statistic.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_257.wav|The council has been open and transparent.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_258.wav|I'll never think of myself as a star.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_259.wav|I felt he was excellent.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_260.wav|It was a policy they were against.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_261.wav|The results are sometimes contentious.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_262.wav|I believe that Scotland has much to gain.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_263.wav|People have been wonderful beyond belief.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_264.wav|Had she enjoyed the experience?|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_265.wav|He has changed the country itself.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_266.wav|The look on his face was something special.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_267.wav|I can certainly see much better.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_268.wav|We then went to see the headmaster.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_269.wav|I needed a little man in the crowd.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_270.wav|It would then be up to the judge.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_271.wav|Are we going to stay up?|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_272.wav|People were actually not on his side.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_273.wav|It was a very difficult period.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_274.wav|It's all going to clear the debt.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_275.wav|It used to be less than five minutes.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_276.wav|It was by the numbers.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_277.wav|My Dad is a hero.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_278.wav|It is my fault.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_279.wav|We are not asking for the moon.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_280.wav|That used to be another thing of mine.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_281.wav|At the election we will oppose the euro.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_282.wav|As a schoolteacher he was an excellent coach.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_283.wav|Teachers have been given the offer.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_284.wav|He called for a public inquiry.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_285.wav|I haven't had a lesson in four years.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_286.wav|I played badly, but it happens.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_287.wav|I have got a wife to feed.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_288.wav|I lost my head.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_289.wav|What are the barriers?|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_290.wav|He is keen to stay in public service.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_291.wav|You are not going in blind.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_292.wav|You had to go and see him.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_293.wav|She says she has grown up.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_294.wav|He met his wife and married in England.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_295.wav|But it could have been written for her.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_296.wav|It makes no sense.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_297.wav|What will they called?|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_298.wav|We come here in peace, for peace.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_299.wav|He will feel the pain again.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_300.wav|After New Labour, we now have New Unionists.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_301.wav|I can't stand this sort of stuff.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_302.wav|Is Saddam a threat?|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_303.wav|The jury is still out.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_304.wav|Hopefully, they will not go through with it.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_305.wav|I can't say that this is very usual.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_306.wav|He is married, with two children.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_307.wav|At Riverside, the rematch was totally different.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_308.wav|We are the gateway to justice.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_309.wav|As in battle, the worst thing is waiting for it.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_310.wav|We understand the changes in the world.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_311.wav|It is a potential factor.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_312.wav|The working families tax credit is far better.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_313.wav|It added to the reverence.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_314.wav|It is too early to say.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_315.wav|It's to do with context.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_316.wav|David Trimble has sold out.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_317.wav|Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_318.wav|I don't understand it.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_319.wav|The teenager had been missing for six months.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_320.wav|He was rejected because he had retired.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_321.wav|And then we got off the plane.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_322.wav|I think it is wide open.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_323.wav|I am totally surprised.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_324.wav|We are all ecstatic.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_325.wav|I hope he has learned from it.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_326.wav|That doesn't just happen, you have to build it.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_327.wav|You are a gambling man.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_328.wav|Who honestly expected anything else?|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_329.wav|The search has been called off.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_330.wav|The matter will come up again.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_331.wav|Our strategy is straightforward.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_332.wav|Surely this is not supposed to happen?|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_333.wav|We must recognise that this outfit is unique.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_334.wav|They were unable to revive him.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_335.wav|This has come as a shock to everyone.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_336.wav|Yes, it was too short a night.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_337.wav|It is not for me, though.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_338.wav|It really was my favourite.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_339.wav|That is why this action has been taken.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_340.wav|They should be looking at his victims.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_341.wav|There were many positives for this club.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_342.wav|It's all about money, money, money.|73,,
wav48/p304/p304_343.wav|There wasn't anything in it.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_344.wav|What do we do for an encore?|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_345.wav|Things start to talk to each other.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_346.wav|I would like to stay with Rangers.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_347.wav|Saddam Hussein is a devil.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_348.wav|Thirty people have applied for his job!|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_349.wav|That is a lot of writing.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_350.wav|There is no excuse for domestic abuse.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_351.wav|It is no place for a poet.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_352.wav|There is room for me.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_353.wav|My life is in the ballet.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_354.wav|For next season, we have time to restructure.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_355.wav|The truth, of course, is very different.|73,,
wav48/p304/p304_356.wav|He has something in common with the Wallabies.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_357.wav|These will take a little time to develop.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_358.wav|This is not a birthday party.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_359.wav|Darren is very, very good.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_360.wav|It's a drop in the bucket.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_361.wav|I've had a hard time, to be honest.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_362.wav|I'd never be satisfied with just the relay.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_363.wav|She is still very poorly.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_364.wav|That's how she wants to remember him.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_365.wav|There was no disruption to services.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_366.wav|We talk about effective military action.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_367.wav|It was a discussion paper.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_368.wav|My neighbours are horrified.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_369.wav|He had no problem with alcohol.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_370.wav|This was a very tragic accident.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_371.wav|If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_372.wav|It is the voice of the survivors.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_373.wav|I'm just a piece in the jigsaw.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_374.wav|I wish him well.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_375.wav|Only the details have to be sorted out.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_376.wav|They say they feel different.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_377.wav|We are in the hat.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_378.wav|Well, what can you do?|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_379.wav|Motorists will welcome this.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_380.wav|It is not the message alone.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_381.wav|She failed to win any of them.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_382.wav|He is at war with his knee.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_383.wav|I think we're going to make it.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_384.wav|I didn't know where they were.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_385.wav|Clubs can only do so much.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_386.wav|Many other areas are coming up.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_387.wav|But it's a subtle process.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_388.wav|But let's not go down that road.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_389.wav|It is not attempting to offer a solution.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_390.wav|Changes need to be made.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_391.wav|I don't care to recall it.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_392.wav|That's the way things are heading.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_393.wav|Hard it will be.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_394.wav|He just attracted people.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_395.wav|It was better than a soap opera.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_396.wav|I doubt it would be genuine.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_397.wav|You must be ready to play anyone.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_398.wav|It would have been a very explosive issue.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_399.wav|It seems a waste of talents.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_400.wav|It is the worst of both worlds.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_401.wav|We need to tighten up.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_402.wav|His body was never found.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_403.wav|Just get on with your job.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_404.wav|We expect a full house on the night.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_405.wav|He said it was his greatest work.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_406.wav|The baby deserves the credit.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_407.wav|They are different types.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_408.wav|Like everything in Scotland, it takes time.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_409.wav|We are not too surprised.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_410.wav|They are not a set of options.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_411.wav|But it was money well spent.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_412.wav|They would never let him go.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_413.wav|Which is worse?|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_414.wav|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.|73,,,
wav48/p304/p304_415.wav|Parliament was evenly divided on the issue.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_416.wav|He took over our lives.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_417.wav|I would think they are just behind them.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_418.wav|We would all have liked to run.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_419.wav|I can understand why they have gone.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_420.wav|That, though, was then.|73,,
wav48/p304/p304_421.wav|People should not become complacent.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_422.wav|I will go out with him any time.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_423.wav|I would have the hammer in the crowd.|73,,,,
wav48/p304/p304_424.wav|Public safety is paramount.|73,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_001.wav|Please call Stella.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|74,,
wav48/p305/p305_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|74,,
wav48/p305/p305_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|74,,
wav48/p305/p305_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|74,,
wav48/p305/p305_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|74,,
wav48/p305/p305_025.wav|Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.|74,,
wav48/p305/p305_026.wav|He added, however, that all options are under review.|74,,
wav48/p305/p305_027.wav|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_028.wav|They keep the atmosphere in mind.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_029.wav|Which brings us to the Scottish connection.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_030.wav|It is a catalogue of obstruction.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_031.wav|I'm happy to contribute to that.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_032.wav|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_033.wav|We had a reunion last week.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_034.wav|We have high hopes that this will work.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_035.wav|Everyone around the club was supportive.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_036.wav|People ask about the concept of a team.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_037.wav|Who has he fought?|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_038.wav|I want a free vote.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_039.wav|He came close to signing for Rangers, too.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_040.wav|It would show them a positive way forward.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_041.wav|Players were held in equally low regard.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_042.wav|He also admitted possessing a firearm.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_043.wav|He stands on Centre Court alone.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_044.wav|Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_045.wav|There was a fine line to tread.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_046.wav|They receive a high profile in the media.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_047.wav|They were urged to get themselves in order.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_048.wav|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_049.wav|Here is a tale of devotion to duty.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_050.wav|But don't expect an easy ride.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_051.wav|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_052.wav|Some US embassy staff have left the country.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_053.wav|Her mother said she fell off a swing.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_054.wav|We see little sign of improvement.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_055.wav|The study, carried out by the consumer magazine Which?|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_056.wav|Ten years on, that advice is beginning to pay dividends.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_057.wav|For example they could be in school uniform.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_058.wav|This film will be totally awesome.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_059.wav|Three further cases were confirmed yesterday in Scotland.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_060.wav|There is no mandate for a regime change.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_061.wav|He did the right thing by ignoring me.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_062.wav|That tells you something about them.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_063.wav|The father was treated like a criminal, and why?|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_064.wav|This rule is archaic.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_065.wav|I am a drug addict.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_066.wav|I've had to take time off work today.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_067.wav|This wasn't just a big crowd.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_068.wav|I wondered about changing back to rugby.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_069.wav|Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_070.wav|However, consumers may take a different view.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_071.wav|Nancy is not sure how she feels.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_072.wav|How do you resurrect a dying town?|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_073.wav|I've put my own money into this project.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_074.wav|I've come here for the jersey.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_075.wav|It's been a terrible ordeal for Margaret.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_076.wav|I'm so proud of my team.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_077.wav|That would open the gates of hell.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_078.wav|This has not, and has been neglected.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_079.wav|Waiting times for these services are too long.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_080.wav|If you're a national company, you must provide it all.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_081.wav|In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_082.wav|But they must serve their sentence in Scotland.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_083.wav|However, it is much bigger than that.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_084.wav|This season has been great for me, it's been an experience.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_085.wav|The jury is still out.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_086.wav|He asked me in a tolerance zone.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_087.wav|For now, though, my future is with Rangers.|74,,
wav48/p305/p305_088.wav|I drove the ball well.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_089.wav|If so, how does it intend to achieve this result?|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_090.wav|His handling raises a wider issue.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_091.wav|This is not a recipe for conflict.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_092.wav|He had done his homework properly.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_093.wav|You've got it coming Kabul.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_094.wav|Alan Milburn, the health secretary, refused to comment.|74,,
wav48/p305/p305_095.wav|We will have to see, but it makes you think.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_096.wav|We must keep our feet on the ground.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_097.wav|My grandparents were terrified.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_098.wav|Are they control freaks?|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_099.wav|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_100.wav|They never looked like winning it either.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_101.wav|The party lasted all night.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_102.wav|No details of the talks were given.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_103.wav|It is understood they saw one body.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_104.wav|It was a wilful act of violence.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_105.wav|T, Is there anything in the wound?|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_106.wav|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_107.wav|The research is published in the journal, Nature.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_108.wav|She is a double victim.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_109.wav|They make a selective perception process.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_110.wav|Everything on our programme is brilliant and diverse.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_111.wav|It's the way we go about it.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_112.wav|There was an e-mail.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_113.wav|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_114.wav|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.|74,,
wav48/p305/p305_115.wav|Each day is a new beginning.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_116.wav|My daughter is an adult.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_117.wav|Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_118.wav|We've come from a long way back.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_119.wav|A lot of things can go wrong.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_120.wav|He seemed to lose his focus.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_121.wav|It is a vicious circle.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_122.wav|She was eight months pregnant at the time.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_123.wav|There has been no delay on government orders.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_124.wav|Women were mostly notable by their absence.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_125.wav|Everyone needs a holiday, even the Salvation Army.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_126.wav|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_127.wav|How do you respond to losing your child?|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_128.wav|Who is the employer?|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_129.wav|This is the biggest thing in the world, isn't it?|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_130.wav|McMaster is keen to draw attention to others.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_131.wav|On this form, they have a real chance of going up.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_132.wav|Two charges of threatening crew members were dropped.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_133.wav|You can never have enough money.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_134.wav|Being a taxi driver right now is horrible.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_135.wav|I COULD hardly keep up with Professor McKean.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_136.wav|Our plans for Dunfermline have not changed.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_137.wav|Paterson can afford to be generous.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_138.wav|Another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_139.wav|They do the work, you know.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_140.wav|Thus far we have received no complaints.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_141.wav|I haven't made the donation yet.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_142.wav|Other people also tried.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_143.wav|Slater was fortunate to be wearing a helmet.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_144.wav|It would have very little impact on them.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_145.wav|It would still have been a good film, but very different.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_146.wav|My future is in the marathon.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_147.wav|They were even being used by primary pupils.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_148.wav|This event allows us to emphasise the positive.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_149.wav|They chose to side with terror.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_150.wav|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_151.wav|They just made me feel dizzy.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_152.wav|He must have sat down, relieved it was over.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_153.wav|He will do so today in Monte Carlo.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_154.wav|Health care workers and labourers followed.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_155.wav|Blair also faces pressure from within the cabinet.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_156.wav|Yesterday's performance was exactly that.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_157.wav|We have all been shocked by her death.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_158.wav|We are asking the council to think again.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_159.wav|He had worked there for only two days.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_160.wav|Hopefully, now we're getting it.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_161.wav|But someone forgot to tell the Chechens.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_162.wav|For starters, many of the Scotland team didn't turn up.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_163.wav|They want to shut the Scottish Office.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_164.wav|Scotland need to work on two key areas.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_165.wav|We have already begun to do that here.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_166.wav|The home team also had their moments.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_167.wav|They refused to fire on their own countrymen.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_168.wav|In my opinion it was a mistake, and never on purpose.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_169.wav|That is where the club has gone wrong.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_170.wav|I got off to a great start.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_171.wav|It is scheduled to go ahead next Saturday.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_172.wav|The actor has met with Mandela.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_173.wav|Singing has gone out of fashion.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_174.wav|We begin, as ever, with a reminder of the end.|74,,
wav48/p305/p305_175.wav|I got on very well with Allan.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_176.wav|That has given me great confidence.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_177.wav|This is a dream come true for me.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_178.wav|He was lying face down in the water.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_179.wav|He urged people to forgive.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_180.wav|So he is open to ideas.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_181.wav|Central to their cause was Barry Nicholson.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_182.wav|Not that anyone has actually suffered, for her art.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_183.wav|We are expected to do better than before.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_184.wav|The attacker died in the crash.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_185.wav|I am not even thinking about that.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_186.wav|Angola was a really hard place.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_187.wav|It is giving out the wrong message.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_188.wav|It wasn't a flashy performance, it was very workmanlike.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_189.wav|The sleeper was six hours late.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_190.wav|Tax is a matter for national governments.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_191.wav|We want to keep the pound.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_192.wav|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_193.wav|He needed seven hours of surgery.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_194.wav|Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_195.wav|It just came into my head that day.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_196.wav|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_197.wav|They were later released, and last night were staying with relatives.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_198.wav|I am saddened to hear of the accident.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_199.wav|Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.|74,,
wav48/p305/p305_200.wav|He would help me with the form.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_201.wav|The actors just have to say so.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_202.wav|The minister is the engineer.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_203.wav|I think it was briefly considered.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_204.wav|It's a hidden problem.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_205.wav|I lost a part of me.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_206.wav|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.|74,,
wav48/p305/p305_207.wav|It's part of the game, isn't it?|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_208.wav|I believe in the Church.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_209.wav|Others were even less confident.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_210.wav|It will only work with changes in lifestyle.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_211.wav|So people will come out with these things.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_212.wav|You may have a short memory.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_213.wav|My only ambition is to enjoy my work.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_214.wav|The whole thing is utterly transparent.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_215.wav|Every game against New Zealand is.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_216.wav|That doesn't mean the Cabinet has to endorse.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_217.wav|He takes his time, and won't be rushed.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_218.wav|It shows that painting is still relevant.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_219.wav|Then there's one where people play for fun.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_220.wav|It may be his last for a while, too.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_221.wav|They have enough intrusion at the time.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_222.wav|Then one night only three people turn up.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_223.wav|The parents will have a great time, too.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_224.wav|Now we see the impact of global politics.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_225.wav|Borrowing power was one of those improvements.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_226.wav|Appointments should be made on merit.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_227.wav|There have been a lot of lessons learned.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_228.wav|I think we will join the single currency.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_229.wav|Gilbert was not amused.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_230.wav|Everything was up for grabs.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_231.wav|I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.|74,,
wav48/p305/p305_232.wav|There will not be any charges.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_233.wav|Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_234.wav|Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_235.wav|I think we have a very strong case.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_236.wav|It should be a great game, though.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_237.wav|You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_238.wav|Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_239.wav|So the process was refined.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_240.wav|I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_241.wav|I have been here for only three months.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_242.wav|They were not doing it too well, either.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_243.wav|He added, It's not a racial problem.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_244.wav|We hope this scheme will change that.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_245.wav|How could anyone take issue with that?|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_246.wav|The decision is an absolute disgrace.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_247.wav|They were at her bedside when she died.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_248.wav|They had had time for little else.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_249.wav|We have reports of this throughout Scotland.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_250.wav|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_251.wav|She did not attend the courtroom.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_252.wav|In the meantime, he added, prevention was the key.|74,,
wav48/p305/p305_253.wav|The composer therefore believes he can do it.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_254.wav|I still feel like a wee boy.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_255.wav|He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_256.wav|But there was a shift.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_257.wav|Israel has done very little until now.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_258.wav|Debate was impassioned and furious.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_259.wav|The death rates are still as high.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_260.wav|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_261.wav|We certainly will need to watch him.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_262.wav|I don't think it could be clearer.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_263.wav|We can only go up.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_264.wav|He put some colour into Scottish history.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_265.wav|Our offer will remain on the table.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_266.wav|He is a man who lives to work.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_267.wav|The website is now being amended.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_268.wav|It's an internal matter.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_269.wav|If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_270.wav|The breakdown was much later in her life.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_271.wav|Whoever said that cannot have seen it.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_272.wav|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.|74,,
wav48/p305/p305_273.wav|I hadn't seen them in eight years.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_274.wav|Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.|74,,
wav48/p305/p305_275.wav|I am now just a bit uneasy.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_276.wav|However, Sharon rejected the claims.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_277.wav|They married in August last year.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_278.wav|Yet he chose to do something different.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_279.wav|He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy.|74,,
wav48/p305/p305_280.wav|The case will now go to appeal.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_281.wav|They really did a great job.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_282.wav|Our nation has been changed by this event.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_283.wav|It was worth a photograph.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_284.wav|I love you so very much.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_285.wav|The road was closed for several hours.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_286.wav|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_287.wav|Surrey police said no body had been found.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_288.wav|My aim is a top six finish.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_289.wav|We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_290.wav|Thousands of homes were left without power supplies.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_291.wav|I love the tradition of vaudeville.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_292.wav|Most of the public are behind me.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_293.wav|It really is a gift to the world.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_294.wav|This comes down to a problem of arrogance.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_295.wav|My house was shaking at the time.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_296.wav|I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_297.wav|This is a very positive step forward.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_298.wav|This is a huge confidence boost.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_299.wav|That's how it worked in Bosnia.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_300.wav|Nobody even knew it had happened.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_301.wav|She is a very lucky lady.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_302.wav|We've been there for seven years.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_303.wav|They made a huge impression on me.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_304.wav|His signature is his handwriting.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_305.wav|He admitted there were two aspects of fear.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_306.wav|It also highlighted some local hero districts.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_307.wav|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_308.wav|It worked, up to a point.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_309.wav|One season, they might do well.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_310.wav|NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_311.wav|We've got a great defensive club.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_312.wav|It's up to their parents to choose.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_313.wav|I feel privileged to be here.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_314.wav|She told me to apply for the crest.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_315.wav|I think the Government should pay for that.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_316.wav|It is still holding good today.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_317.wav|The budget was too low for that.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_318.wav|His sister added, We expected him to be jailed.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_319.wav|The airspace above the theatre was closed off.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_320.wav|We cannot rely on protracted legal proceedings.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_321.wav|I know the worry over Iraq.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_322.wav|I just could not cope.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_323.wav|We didn't know he was even out.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_324.wav|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_325.wav|Here are some possible solutions.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_326.wav|He made so many bad decisions.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_327.wav|We are now up against it.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_328.wav|It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_329.wav|I would have dropped out otherwise.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_330.wav|Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_331.wav|They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_332.wav|I think he has undergone a sea change.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_333.wav|One must hope not!|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_334.wav|The casting of her husband was an accident.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_335.wav|From a marketing standpoint, you can understand their concern.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_336.wav|That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_337.wav|That's what it's all about, isn't it?|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_338.wav|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_339.wav|This time, there were no such rewards.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_340.wav|Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_341.wav|I'm just doing artwork.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_342.wav|And we still have to pay his salary.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_343.wav|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_344.wav|So there's a double whammy.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_345.wav|I didn't have a trio.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_346.wav|Their three other children had died as infants.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_347.wav|We knew nothing about it.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_348.wav|I am astonished by this decision.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_349.wav|I hope my successor will do the same.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_350.wav|We have got a full house tonight.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_351.wav|Our children are our future.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_352.wav|We will see how he is.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_353.wav|The fans will support us.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_354.wav|It was a long process, but we got there.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_355.wav|It has, however, been a long time coming.|74,,
wav48/p305/p305_356.wav|The whole team was rubbish.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_357.wav|Now we need to keep our heads up.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_358.wav|I put the drawing down.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_359.wav|They feel it belongs to them.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_360.wav|They must act now to tighten the rules.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_361.wav|They too refused to come out and talk.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_362.wav|It gave me something to focus on.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_363.wav|It's the curse of our time, irony.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_364.wav|It's a source of deep concern.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_365.wav|Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_366.wav|But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_367.wav|Last month he made his debut in Japan.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_368.wav|The Dow Jones is way up.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_369.wav|Now there is an even bigger target.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_370.wav|There has been a big change in defence.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_371.wav|The Treasury confirmed that the latter was correct.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_372.wav|There is nothing like a fresh start.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_373.wav|The company has other problems with the shells.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_374.wav|This must have been severe.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_375.wav|We're all in a state of shock.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_376.wav|I thought he was part of the camera.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_377.wav|Farmers have been an endangered species.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_378.wav|Injury has played a part, but not a big one.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_379.wav|Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_380.wav|He was released in March this year.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_381.wav|The Chosen One doesn't always excel.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_382.wav|Lambert will be playing against Belgium.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_383.wav|We're not an employment agency.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_384.wav|People might not actually want the job.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_385.wav|The court had a number of empty seats.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_386.wav|It is the logical extension of audio description.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_387.wav|It broke up my marriage.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_388.wav|Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_389.wav|He also was in debt to drug dealers.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_390.wav|The package has been properly costed.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_391.wav|This is entirely appropriate and overdue.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_392.wav|The love affair was over.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_393.wav|For some, it was more painful than others.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_394.wav|John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint.|74,,
wav48/p305/p305_395.wav|I can't stop people thinking.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_396.wav|The workers said they were treated like animals.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_397.wav|She had every right to read the warrant.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_398.wav|Several people were out in the street.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_399.wav|There is too much at stake for that.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_400.wav|A review group will report on Tuesday.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_401.wav|In some cases, the nation should be grateful.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_402.wav|The place became a war zone.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_403.wav|It is not an abortion.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_404.wav|It was to get even better for Motherwell.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_405.wav|The surprise is its product is so poor.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_406.wav|Thus the story will continue to thrive.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_407.wav|See it while you can.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_408.wav|I didn't do too badly myself.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_409.wav|Their expressions only reflected those of the audience.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_410.wav|He has never even been to Ireland.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_411.wav|We believe the squad will stay together.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_412.wav|Such people do not exist.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_413.wav|We suspect he was pleased.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_414.wav|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_415.wav|She always wanted her own way.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_416.wav|But it is all by design.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_417.wav|We've still got a say in this.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_418.wav|She can't say where she was, what she did.|74,,,
wav48/p305/p305_419.wav|I'll take what comes along.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_420.wav|Jack McConnell is the obvious choice.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_421.wav|Women reported more depression than men.|74,,,,
wav48/p305/p305_422.wav|The euro is your money, it is our money.|74,,,
wav48/p306/p306_001.wav|Please call Stella.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|75,,
wav48/p306/p306_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its paths high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|75,,
wav48/p306/p306_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|75,,
wav48/p306/p306_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|75,,
wav48/p306/p306_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|75,,
wav48/p306/p306_025.wav|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_026.wav|This is not a floating Las Vegas.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_027.wav|This is not an amnesty.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_028.wav|The important thing was to be there, and to experience it.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_029.wav|Of course, this is nice to hear.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_030.wav|It was between myself, the management, and the team.|75,,
wav48/p306/p306_031.wav|I don't believe you own anything.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_032.wav|The music industry hasn't changed at all.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_033.wav|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_034.wav|Blood samples have been taken.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_035.wav|Someone came down and said, Can you read a script?|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_036.wav|He said he now intends to fly today.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_037.wav|This means that our programme is quite unusual.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_038.wav|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_039.wav|A further police inquiry is currently being held.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_040.wav|Some people begin to turn away, to go home.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_041.wav|You're not stopping people using sunbeds.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_042.wav|A recording contract is on the horizon.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_043.wav|It has been a horrible, horrible time.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_044.wav|We like being the underdogs.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_045.wav|They said construction work could begin within weeks.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_046.wav|We will continue to operate within the sport.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_047.wav|But the law is very clear on this.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_048.wav|But all forms of the illness are treatable.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_049.wav|It is also central to the unfolding drama.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_050.wav|Except for this, it was offside.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_051.wav|On the contrary, some of the music is very expensive.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_052.wav|It's a grey area.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_053.wav|Retirement, who knows?|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_054.wav|He was shocked by what he saw.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_055.wav|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_056.wav|It comes on like a tidal wave.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_057.wav|England and Wales are likely to pull out.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_058.wav|Mr Cook, a left-winger from Britain, would be ideally replaced.|75,,
wav48/p306/p306_059.wav|He was taken ill in December last year.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_060.wav|We welcome the decisions of Mr Byers.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_061.wav|It's all too short term.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_062.wav|This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.|75,,
wav48/p306/p306_063.wav|Meanwhile, the weather was causing widespread disruption.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_064.wav|Robin Williams is very subdued.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_065.wav|His rival's are spoken with elan.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_066.wav|He also does not get on with Christina.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_067.wav|If convicted, they face the death penalty.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_068.wav|How things have changed since then.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_069.wav|Therefore, it isn't getting the respect it deserves.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_070.wav|This is the way things should be handled.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_071.wav|For me, the tour is wide open this year.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_072.wav|In the past few years, they have started to fight back.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_073.wav|The Prime Minister was very honest and sincere.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_074.wav|What are you supposed to do, just walk away?|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_075.wav|She opens tonight in Glasgow, at the King's Theatre.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_076.wav|Henman is taking nothing for granted.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_077.wav|You'd think there was a match on today.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_078.wav|We must move on.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_079.wav|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_080.wav|The table was compiled by the Daily Telegraph.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_081.wav|His options are severely limited.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_082.wav|It is truly fields of miracles.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_083.wav|They are not an item.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_084.wav|Why did they let him go?|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_085.wav|Another suggestion was dismissed by Virgin.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_086.wav|I have made good progress.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_087.wav|We do need a new one.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_088.wav|They had to be cut from the wreckage.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_089.wav|We defended well, but couldn't do much in attack.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_090.wav|What happens when the funding is exhausted.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_091.wav|He then had a swipe at Hearts.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_092.wav|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_093.wav|But the relief was short-lived.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_094.wav|You had better believe it.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_095.wav|The mood is upbeat.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_096.wav|They told us about it the next day.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_097.wav|It's not a new concept in jazz.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_098.wav|There are a huge number of arts.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_099.wav|They are, therefore, not in favour of dispersal of sex offenders.|75,,
wav48/p306/p306_100.wav|My office is bare.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_101.wav|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_102.wav|Where is the anthrax?|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_103.wav|Housing is in very short supply.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_104.wav|After all, he is the King of Scotland.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_105.wav|People just came on their own.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_106.wav|We are so, so lucky, so many people have died.|75,,
wav48/p306/p306_107.wav|The culture is extremely widespread and vibrant.|75,,,,

wav48/p306/p306_239.wav|It's just gotten too big.|75,,,,

wav48/p306/p306_244.wav|At that time, there was no infection within five miles.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_245.wav|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_246.wav|Around the building, the atmosphere is brittle and hung over.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_247.wav|The performance, for this listener, didn't come off.|75,,

wav48/p306/p306_253.wav|A management agreement, however, was conceded.|75,,
wav48/p306/p306_254.wav|People would say, He thinks he can do that as well.|75,,,

wav48/p306/p306_265.wav|Holland won by five wickets.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_266.wav|His expulsion would not solve the problem.|75,,,,

wav48/p306/p306_269.wav|THE best marriages are made in heaven.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_270.wav|The main thing is that they enjoy it.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_272.wav|We have to sort it out ourselves.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_273.wav|The board has rejected her proposals.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_274.wav|It does not move, which is amazing.|75,,,

wav48/p306/p306_278.wav|That, however, can only be achieved by constant investment.|75,,
wav48/p306/p306_279.wav|But, in the end, he did - and blew him away.|75,,
wav48/p306/p306_281.wav|This is a great shame.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_282.wav|That was merely their initial problem.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_283.wav|I'm going to help out in the summer, as producer.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_284.wav|We said, What do you mean?|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_285.wav|I need them to set my career.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_286.wav|The law will take its course.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_287.wav|They don't know each other, but they have made this commitment.|75,,,

wav48/p306/p306_289.wav|The fund has three elements.|75,,,,

wav48/p306/p306_291.wav|It's not even finished.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_292.wav|Everyone knew where they were.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_293.wav|As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminister Hall.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_294.wav|In the old days, it was easy.|75,,,

wav48/p306/p306_297.wav|There is bound to be a formal complaint.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_298.wav|My view has now completely changed.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_299.wav|They finished second and third.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_300.wav|We agreed to disagree.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_301.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_302.wav|It had not been a terribly inspiring end, either.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_303.wav|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_304.wav|We've always had three options, and none of them perfect.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_305.wav|People can get them if they want.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_306.wav|Their message was simple.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_307.wav|They're currently managed by Ian Wilson.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_308.wav|He is a law unto himself.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_309.wav|With him are the symbols of his faith.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_310.wav|There are no easy solutions to this problem.|75,,,,

wav48/p306/p306_314.wav|It was just completely erased.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_315.wav|A great deal has been achieved.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_316.wav|I've been thinking about it for a year.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_317.wav|I enjoy playing with both of them.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_318.wav|Too often it is not.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_319.wav|I tend to not look back.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_320.wav|Confidence among the allies began to slip.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_321.wav|I got a yellow card.|75,,,,

wav48/p306/p306_326.wav|She is now on the back benches.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_327.wav|It may also be her last.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_328.wav|Maybe it helps us.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_329.wav|Three bystanders were killed.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_330.wav|We should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_331.wav|However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_332.wav|He made no big mistakes.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_333.wav|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_334.wav|We will be homeless.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_335.wav|I believe he can do a better job.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_336.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_337.wav|Instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_338.wav|That decision was applauded by Williamson.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_339.wav|But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_340.wav|Well, was it?|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_341.wav|We won't let you down.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_342.wav|What kind of person is he?|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_343.wav|Does it work, is it safe, and is it right?|75,,
wav48/p306/p306_344.wav|He was visited by UK consular officials.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_345.wav|So we shall remain vigilant, and keep the pressure on him.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_346.wav|English is the language of pop music.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_347.wav|The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.|75,,,,

wav48/p306/p306_354.wav|You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_355.wav|I didn't even have the first idea.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_356.wav|No person was charged.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_357.wav|I've only met him three times.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_358.wav|You see, my back has gone.|75,,,
wav48/p306/p306_359.wav|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.|75,,,,
wav48/p306/p306_360.wav|She looked very, very poor.|75,,,
wav48/p307/p307_001.wav|Please call Stella.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_025.wav|But it was a great decision he joked.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_026.wav|They changed the world of music.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_027.wav|You need a long-term strategy in football.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_028.wav|The law has got to be upheld.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_029.wav|But we're not the same person.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_030.wav|He had just returned to Thailand from Canada.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_031.wav|I saw the explosion and panicked.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_032.wav|The punishment was swift.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_033.wav|However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_034.wav|I kept my side of the bargain.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_035.wav|It also makes for interesting viewing.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_036.wav|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_037.wav|He released a half-dozen solo albums.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_038.wav|That respect is missing in the Netherlands.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_039.wav|There's always a solution, somewhere you can meet in the middle.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_040.wav|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_041.wav|It doesn't make them evil.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_042.wav|I have played really well all year.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_043.wav|Parts of the system are already overstretched.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_044.wav|Tourism in Scotland is facing a financial disaster.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_045.wav|It's like, If he's all right, we will go with him.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_046.wav|She added, It is the same story in both countries.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_047.wav|Lara is very, very much a girl.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_048.wav|I try not to expect anything.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_049.wav|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_050.wav|There will be plenty to keep them occupied.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_051.wav|It was, however, the wrong side.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_052.wav|She is now planning a visit.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_053.wav|It also calls for licensing of collection centres.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_054.wav|Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_055.wav|Today, we begin to answer that question.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_056.wav|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_057.wav|I keep my fingers crossed.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_058.wav|The encounter was to change his life.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_059.wav|It's the best of both worlds.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_060.wav|They have a way of proclaiming themselves.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_061.wav|That is why we want this decision reversed.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_062.wav|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_063.wav|Staff were invited to make their own proposals.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_064.wav|We tried everything, but it just wasn't to be today.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_065.wav|After this, the exercise was due to begin.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_066.wav|And she doesn't feel like Annika is better.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_067.wav|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_068.wav|CELTIC Connections is here again - and the great debate.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_069.wav|I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_070.wav|When he took over it really took off.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_071.wav|That's just the way the game is evolving.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_072.wav|Michael is putting on a brave face.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_073.wav|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_074.wav|The next thing will be cutting journey times.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_075.wav|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_076.wav|This is a mental challenge.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_077.wav|Their one weakness was running between the wickets.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_078.wav|He accused the Prime Minister of dithering.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_079.wav|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_080.wav|Ferguson did not hesitate.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_081.wav|He came in an army uniform.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_082.wav|However, within those figures, income from overseas visitors increased.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_083.wav|Cars are great for going long distances.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_084.wav|It was published yesterday on the internet.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_085.wav|I knew he would play two weeks ago.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_086.wav|The general secretary, represents a new era in Labour party politics.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_087.wav|It has never been worthwhile.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_088.wav|So other options had to be explored.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_089.wav|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_090.wav|We will learn lessons from what has happened.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_091.wav|People love to see this stuff.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_092.wav|One film a year is, he says, his natural rhythm.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_093.wav|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_094.wav|His female companion was being treated for shock.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_095.wav|I have no plans to change the oath.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_096.wav|We did not even get a free kick.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_097.wav|He was married with a young child.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_098.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_099.wav|Anyone remaining after that will be targeted.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_100.wav|They serve a multitude of purposes.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_101.wav|But his attendance is not guaranteed.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_102.wav|I am sure all schools would accept that.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_103.wav|I am very sorry to be here.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_104.wav|I needed a change, a new challenge.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_105.wav|Is your life a little too easy?|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_106.wav|I think my game is suited to grass.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_107.wav|The little boy was playing football at lunchtime.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_108.wav|Industry leaders reacted angrily.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_109.wav|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_110.wav|People want to see me on the screen.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_111.wav|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_112.wav|And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_113.wav|The conversion didn't go over either.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_114.wav|He took away my childhood.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_115.wav|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_116.wav|The motive for the shooting was not known.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_117.wav|Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_118.wav|Serb forces then opened fire in their direction.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_119.wav|It is not great art.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_120.wav|You do not change overnight.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_121.wav|The way they play, it is hard to score against them.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_122.wav|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_123.wav|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_124.wav|We all like to see forgiveness and redemption.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_125.wav|We aim to put them out of business.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_126.wav|Tony Blair should get out more.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_127.wav|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_128.wav|He was just awesome.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_129.wav|We now have to concentrate on the league.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_130.wav|We need to move forward together.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_131.wav|She died in hospital two hours later.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_132.wav|She was making a living, but her career was going nowhere.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_133.wav|Both were later released after a check-up.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_134.wav|No-one, however, was complacent about the size of the task.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_135.wav|How good is Lennox Lewis?|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_136.wav|I would ask the fans to be patient.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_137.wav|The ethos of the school was outstanding.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_138.wav|The son has autism and other problems.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_139.wav|I'm very puzzled by it.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_140.wav|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_141.wav|Volvo is grateful to its staff in Irvine.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_142.wav|We are both very confused and extremely angry.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_143.wav|All things are possible if you believe.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_144.wav|This was not just incongruous.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_145.wav|It is patently true.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_146.wav|You hope he prevails.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_147.wav|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_148.wav|The fellowship is much more than a commission, he said.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_149.wav|What the Department of Transport will make clear.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_150.wav|But it looks good for next year.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_151.wav|I haven't just gone in, done a three-hour rehearsal, and gone.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_152.wav|He is wanted by German police for questioning.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_153.wav|He was forced to quit.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_154.wav|It is good for their eyesight.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_155.wav|I was loving that little girl.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_156.wav|But you can't have it both ways.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_157.wav|We don't just play golf in Scotland.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_158.wav|That's why the young musicians have joined.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_159.wav|The death toll included five children.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_160.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_161.wav|There is no credible official announcement.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_162.wav|I understand the medical concerns.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_163.wav|This is a United Kingdom.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_164.wav|I thought it was a fantastic game.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_165.wav|I'm aware that somebody made a threat.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_166.wav|However, who could have predicted this result?|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_167.wav|Shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_168.wav|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_169.wav|They were behind the wheel.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_170.wav|The pressure on the aid agencies is immense.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_171.wav|The problem arises because he does so much.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_172.wav|The answer is mayhem.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_173.wav|Our young people are leaving.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_174.wav|What, then, is the real thing?|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_175.wav|I can't believe anyone would agree with it.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_176.wav|That will be the sweetness.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_177.wav|But is it ethical to practice in humans?|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_178.wav|The big issue for us is the review.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_179.wav|There was a fossil on screen.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_180.wav|I always loved the lightning in the movies.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_181.wav|This does not create any precedent.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_182.wav|I see social work as a vocation, a commitment.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_183.wav|It has removed a bit of guilt.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_184.wav|I'm just asking them to improve their disciplines.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_185.wav|You can say he gets a sizeable amount.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_186.wav|The early evidence suggests he did not.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_187.wav|Ferguson had a most productive afternoon.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_188.wav|I hope you miss the cut.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_189.wav|The role was perfect for Russell.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_190.wav|Morale is very high, despite the growing risks.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_191.wav|We are seeking funds from government departments.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_192.wav|That, though, was again according to the manager McCall.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_193.wav|He scored one goal and was on fire.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_194.wav|I hate to say it, but you can understand it.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_195.wav|Harold is a rarity.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_196.wav|Walk out the door and anything can happen.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_197.wav|I want him to take on Gomez.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_198.wav|Her condition last night was described as critical.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_199.wav|Frankly, it was worth the booking.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_200.wav|They tend to be easily influenced by others.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_201.wav|Well, what do you know?|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_202.wav|There are some serious ethical issues involved.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_203.wav|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_204.wav|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_205.wav|He will emerge as a world leader.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_206.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_207.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_208.wav|We have no choice but to shut down.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_209.wav|The prognosis is excellent.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_210.wav|They always want to give a performance.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_211.wav|But he just carried on anyway.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_212.wav|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_213.wav|I would not want to be young again.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_214.wav|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_215.wav|The Yugoslav army will still be there.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_216.wav|There are schoolboys in uniform.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_217.wav|They were later discharged from hospital.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_218.wav|These findings would be made public.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_219.wav|What are you not good at?|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_220.wav|All the lads are totally focused on that.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_221.wav|He added later, Normally, it's not a dangerous river.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_222.wav|This makes no sense!|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_223.wav|I go home only once.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_224.wav|It had a gigantic effect.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_225.wav|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_226.wav|If not, a deal could take many months.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_227.wav|The team this year is going places.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_228.wav|More money for students would help - in an ideal world.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_229.wav|It took more than two years.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_230.wav|Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_231.wav|He said because people had invited him.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_232.wav|That's the key issue isn't it?|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_233.wav|Its workforce is to be made redundant.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_234.wav|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_235.wav|Correction, knowing him, he might.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_236.wav|I came up through the ranks.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_237.wav|Why does she suddenly win everything now?|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_238.wav|We wanted it left for a wee while.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_239.wav|These guys will not lie down.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_240.wav|The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_241.wav|That is nearly four people every day.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_242.wav|There are nine people here now.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_243.wav|His son is a local legend.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_244.wav|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_245.wav|Which perhaps is just as well.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_246.wav|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_247.wav|He would just say it was terrible.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_248.wav|This is the New Edinburgh.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_249.wav|I saw military vehicles in the distance.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_250.wav|I hope it has helped the prisoners.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_251.wav|We kept going right to the final whistle.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_252.wav|For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_253.wav|JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_254.wav|The final stage is paranoia.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_255.wav|I am not holding the club to ransom.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_256.wav|Wanger was never like this.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_257.wav|Pig farmers are completely despondent.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_258.wav|But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_259.wav|We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_260.wav|That's the sort of game you want.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_261.wav|We're not travel agents.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_262.wav|Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_263.wav|We are trying to clarify the issues.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_264.wav|It's the same old story.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_265.wav|He was telling me to keep quiet.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_266.wav|It was a moment of madness.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_267.wav|I do not own the vessel in question.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_268.wav|Racism has no place in any sport.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_269.wav|I am not happy with proposals for widows.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_270.wav|It is believed she had serious head injuries.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_271.wav|Bombing is the easy option.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_272.wav|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_273.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_274.wav|The pilot was making a visual approach.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_275.wav|I'd say we should give it a week.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_276.wav|Many other Scottish locations also feature.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_277.wav|Little Voice is on general release.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_278.wav|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_279.wav|There is no substitute.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_280.wav|That nation is South Africa.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_281.wav|This will secure the future of our industry.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_282.wav|The police have an awful lot to explain.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_283.wav|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_284.wav|That's when you hope to take advantage.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_285.wav|It was an empowering journey.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_286.wav|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_287.wav|It's not unlike the millennium bug.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_288.wav|They had been together for about three years.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_289.wav|Children are using books in a terrible condition.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_290.wav|Everything has been destroyed.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_291.wav|The painting was started, but finishing it was quite another matter.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_292.wav|He is married, with one daughter, and lives in Kent.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_293.wav|We just want to get stuck in now.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_294.wav|Do you come from Moscow?|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_295.wav|Broomfield was the centre of the town.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_296.wav|He or she will oversee the leadership contest.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_297.wav|They are the innocent victims.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_298.wav|We are aware of the tribunal case.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_299.wav|That is the first job of the director - leadership.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_300.wav|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_301.wav|But he was a full, working member of our staff.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_302.wav|Broke the birdie record.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_303.wav|Either group is living in fantasy land.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_304.wav|They tried to give her advice.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_305.wav|That it is a brand name.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_306.wav|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_307.wav|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_308.wav|They will have to make changes.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_309.wav|This fact is supported by audience research.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_310.wav|Of further privacy, he had no need.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_311.wav|Both sides have to step back.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_312.wav|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_313.wav|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_314.wav|It sounds a bit of an own goal.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_315.wav|We are ready for the long haul.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_316.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_317.wav|I look for dancers who are also actors.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_318.wav|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_319.wav|EMI is a prime example.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_320.wav|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_321.wav|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_322.wav|It's a record label, not a form of music.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_323.wav|Not that Agassi was a believer.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_324.wav|A friendship that will endure.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_325.wav|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_326.wav|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_327.wav|Nowadays, it is workers united.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_328.wav|He is young but not too young.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_329.wav|I played well on Saturday and again today.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_330.wav|It will also take evidence from consumers.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_331.wav|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_332.wav|I am not obsessed with sex.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_333.wav|They've been at it for five hours.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_334.wav|There is no answer to it.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_335.wav|There was no let-up for the minnows.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_336.wav|Birthdays are wonderful and terrible things.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_337.wav|His English counterpart agreed.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_338.wav|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_339.wav|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_340.wav|Anyway, she is playing a lesbian.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_341.wav|I am not putting myself down.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_342.wav|He's a joy to follow.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_343.wav|Bob Dylan is getting old.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_344.wav|We were lucky to have survived.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_345.wav|Maybe we expected too much from the fixture.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_346.wav|At this level, you have all to perform well.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_347.wav|I just want to change my life.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_348.wav|He did not oppose the divorce.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_349.wav|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_350.wav|And Michael was just great.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_351.wav|He knew it would cost him millions.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_352.wav|Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_353.wav|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_354.wav|Clearly, she says, she would never resort to such devices.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_355.wav|That only came out during a radio interview.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_356.wav|We are now setting about finding them.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_357.wav|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_358.wav|We must not go down that road.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_359.wav|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_360.wav|I am not among its admirers.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_361.wav|And that match was played in June.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_362.wav|He will address the nation this evening.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_363.wav|They have shown a great desire and attitude.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_364.wav|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_365.wav|Motherwell have no such good fortune.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_366.wav|But he is revelling in the big stage.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_367.wav|Stock markets will be watching closely.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_368.wav|If they have City backing, what is the influence?|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_369.wav|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_370.wav|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_371.wav|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_372.wav|His job was not advertised.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_373.wav|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_374.wav|Scottish life can be like this, too.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_375.wav|He has changed my life for ever.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_376.wav|The home was now under new management.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_377.wav|It is like a theatre of the absurd.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_378.wav|There is no openness.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_379.wav|It's being very carefully looked at.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_380.wav|It was a job he loved.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_381.wav|It may encourage more people to prospect.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_382.wav|Filtering through this material a composite finale emerges.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_383.wav|Where was their passion, the power, the feeling?|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_384.wav|It looks like paradise.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_386.wav|We were short of athletes.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_387.wav|They want to avoid a flashpoint.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_388.wav|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_389.wav|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_390.wav|Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_391.wav|I had no qualms about it.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_392.wav|Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_393.wav|McMaster had already seen the first part.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_394.wav|It's about my time as a guitarist.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_395.wav|We have been working closely with Holyrood.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_396.wav|It was early morning.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_397.wav|Partition is not an option.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_398.wav|What other retailer would do this?|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_399.wav|This is usually done by the space shuttle.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_400.wav|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_401.wav|I won't go back to Holland.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_402.wav|In his absence, the council adopted the change.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_403.wav|There was no cohesion.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_404.wav|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_405.wav|Whether this return was too soon.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_406.wav|Jackson may well be right.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_407.wav|My thoughts are with their families.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_408.wav|I saw some good things.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_410.wav|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_411.wav|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_412.wav|But who gets on the tube?|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_413.wav|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_414.wav|Now you see him, now you don't.|76,,,
wav48/p307/p307_416.wav|So now this series has had its day.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_417.wav|Gaelic provision continued to be good.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_418.wav|Bobby Robson called him a genius.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_419.wav|It's a policy which has worked for us.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_420.wav|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_421.wav|His views are hardly surprising.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_422.wav|His wife Margaret was not in court.|76,,,,
wav48/p307/p307_423.wav|Slowly, however, a picture is emerging in Scotland.|76,,
wav48/p307/p307_424.wav|Nobody else was with me.|76,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_001.wav|Please call Stella.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|77,,
wav48/p308/p308_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_008.wav|They take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|77,,
wav48/p308/p308_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|77,,
wav48/p308/p308_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition on a number of bows.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|77,,
wav48/p308/p308_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|77,,
wav48/p308/p308_025.wav|It does make a big difference.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_026.wav|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_027.wav|Each one has its own system.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_028.wav|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.|77,,
wav48/p308/p308_029.wav|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_030.wav|It is a very special city.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_031.wav|It has been blown out of all proportion.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_032.wav|He is not very big, either.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_033.wav|I've taken to the hills.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_034.wav|My game is in pretty good shape.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_035.wav|How come it is so often unnoticed?|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_036.wav|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_037.wav|We used to keep our business rates.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_038.wav|It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_039.wav|All of us do.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_040.wav|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_041.wav|It could have been just a quick fix.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_042.wav|We are looking for volunteers.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_043.wav|Theatre is not a museum.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_044.wav|Subs not used, McCulloch.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_045.wav|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_046.wav|He could face a jail sentence.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_047.wav|They don't take you to mass graves.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_048.wav|What's it got to do with art?|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_049.wav|Happily we found it in the library.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_050.wav|I know a lot of people who don't.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_051.wav|There was nobody on the roof.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_052.wav|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.|77,,
wav48/p308/p308_053.wav|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_054.wav|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_055.wav|The days of empty promises are over.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_056.wav|Henry was strong and talented.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_057.wav|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_058.wav|We must improve our relations with government.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_059.wav|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_060.wav|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_061.wav|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.|77,
wav48/p308/p308_062.wav|He said it was the worst possible result.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_063.wav|The quality of life is difficult for them.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_064.wav|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_065.wav|It is just part of modern day life.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_066.wav|A young Briton had a lucky escape.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_067.wav|Treatment is not an issue with these people.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_068.wav|YOU thought it was a headache.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_069.wav|I hope we can put it behind us.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_070.wav|But it was to no avail.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_071.wav|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_072.wav|I'm thinking, what would be easier?|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_073.wav|That alibi is now gone.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_074.wav|We actually haven't managed to meet demand.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_075.wav|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_076.wav|You do have a way out.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_077.wav|It is simple, really.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_078.wav|I cannot believe she has been admonished.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_079.wav|I was in jail for five years.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_080.wav|You, the British people, are the boss.|77,,
wav48/p308/p308_081.wav|A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_082.wav|PR for Westminster is their holy grail.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_083.wav|They won the trophy in the Hoops.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_084.wav|I never won a penny throughout my career.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_085.wav|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.|77,,
wav48/p308/p308_086.wav|She could easily have been killed.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_087.wav|Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.|77,
wav48/p308/p308_088.wav|We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_089.wav|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_090.wav|The same goes for personnel.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_091.wav|He was a crazy man.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_092.wav|We don't say there wasn't a massacre.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_093.wav|That was a hard game to play in, very tough.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_094.wav|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_095.wav|There was an element of jealousy.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_096.wav|Craig is still suffering seizures.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_097.wav|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.|77,,
wav48/p308/p308_098.wav|That certainly brought me back down to earth.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_099.wav|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_100.wav|We have no idea what caused the derailment.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_101.wav|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_102.wav|Does it feel like the ideas and emotions?|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_103.wav|He is only now regaining his confidence.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_104.wav|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_105.wav|It separates the men from the boys.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_106.wav|But that attachment took a lot of growing.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_107.wav|You'll get on like a house on fire.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_108.wav|Two and a half million people have died.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_109.wav|Or so it would appear.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_110.wav|I hope they understand that.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_111.wav|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_112.wav|She will also get a pay rise.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_113.wav|They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_114.wav|It is time for a more honest approach.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_115.wav|The move is considered a major breakthrough.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_116.wav|I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_117.wav|I want to play at the highest level.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_118.wav|Stalkers are capable of killing.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_119.wav|It ignores the future.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_120.wav|Britain may now be forced to listen.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_121.wav|The trial is set for February.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_122.wav|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_123.wav|Do not go into government buildings.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_124.wav|There is only one caveat.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_125.wav|We are still getting signals.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_126.wav|And perhaps it is as simple as that.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_127.wav|They prefer the short, intensive session.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_128.wav|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_129.wav|The New Deal will constantly be improved.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_130.wav|THE headless man has finally developed a face.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_131.wav|I heard some of his remarks.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_132.wav|Mary Archer is almost too clever.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_133.wav|I was just overwhelmed.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_134.wav|It had been in place since last July.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_135.wav|The European Court is our only option.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_136.wav|Do you think they would do any better?|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_137.wav|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_138.wav|Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_139.wav|The singer's condition was not specified.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_140.wav|How much of a cop out is that?|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_141.wav|The whole region is in shock.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_142.wav|It will be the final push.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_143.wav|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_144.wav|You were the kidnappers.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_145.wav|It is a very interesting subject.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_146.wav|The women were on their way home yesterday.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_147.wav|I could feel the blood on my face.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_148.wav|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_149.wav|Well, it's not before time, is it?|77,,
wav48/p308/p308_150.wav|Debbie Harry was cool.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_151.wav|Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_152.wav|That sort of thing is long gone.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_153.wav|I'm afraid to say anything.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_154.wav|I know you went back this morning.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_155.wav|We did not want an absentee landlord.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_156.wav|These men could be anywhere in the world.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_157.wav|Smaller parties have reason to be pleased.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_158.wav|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_159.wav|It's my favourite place to hang out.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_160.wav|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_161.wav|He will make an excellent chief inspector.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_162.wav|The red card was okay.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_163.wav|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.|77,,
wav48/p308/p308_164.wav|But they will not be compelled to join.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_165.wav|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_166.wav|I was doing well at the hustings.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_167.wav|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_168.wav|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_169.wav|We must put a marker down.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_170.wav|But she's also beautiful behind the face.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_171.wav|There is no date on this document.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_172.wav|And now he tells us.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_173.wav|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.|77,,
wav48/p308/p308_174.wav|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.|77,,
wav48/p308/p308_175.wav|It is time to come into the limelight.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_176.wav|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_177.wav|His name is Michael Owen.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_178.wav|For now, we must take one game at a time.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_179.wav|I will have to order its destruction.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_180.wav|I foolishly had done nothing about it.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_181.wav|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_182.wav|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_183.wav|Smith has not let him down.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_184.wav|No, it's actually in a block of flats.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_185.wav|Reviving the Scottish Open is one option.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_186.wav|They've two children.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_187.wav|Luckily, our patient was stable.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_188.wav|I'm really proud of my young players.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_189.wav|People buy everything with cash.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_190.wav|There was great support all round the route.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_191.wav|It's amazing it happened in the daytime.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_192.wav|I felt we had fallen back a little.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_193.wav|Scottish fishermen condemned the decision.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_194.wav|Or so we have long assumed.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_195.wav|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_196.wav|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_197.wav|It's not just for classical music.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_198.wav|This must be kept in total perspective.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_199.wav|All of the names are familiar to me.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_200.wav|They had not been handcuffed.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_201.wav|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_202.wav|I've never been limited on drugs.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_203.wav|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_204.wav|Have we not had the rainy season already?|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_205.wav|We have chosen for the patients.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_206.wav|He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_207.wav|Why should we even be asked to share?|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_208.wav|Which means it matters.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_209.wav|There is great potential on this river.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_210.wav|I was surprised by his response.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_211.wav|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_212.wav|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_213.wav|Officials say the city must achieve this.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_214.wav|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_215.wav|Is this accurate?|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_216.wav|A judicial review is also being considered.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_217.wav|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_218.wav|They could go no further forward.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_219.wav|I don't know why you say goodbye.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_220.wav|Appointed general secretary last September.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_221.wav|They make it look very easy.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_222.wav|It was a total surprise.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_223.wav|I had enough on.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_224.wav|And we're not there yet.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_225.wav|No meaningful response was issued.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_226.wav|It is a form of physical exercise.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_227.wav|plays in dark blue.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_228.wav|But, by that time, of course, it is again.|77,
wav48/p308/p308_229.wav|It is something that we will put right.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_230.wav|Survival is our aim.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_231.wav|There is no reason at all.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_232.wav|This is her first senior Scottish selection.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_233.wav|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_234.wav|I'm pleased with the horse.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_235.wav|But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_236.wav|There is a club on the rise.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_237.wav|I had a sense of deja vu.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_238.wav|His silence on the issue is interesting.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_239.wav|They follow him everywhere.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_240.wav|I couldn't make out what was going on.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_241.wav|There was no safety net.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_242.wav|So we said, no, we're not going to do that.|77,,
wav48/p308/p308_243.wav|I had a choice, and didn't have to do that.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_244.wav|I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_245.wav|Mr Miller is married with three children.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_246.wav|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_247.wav|We have great sympathy with Danny.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_248.wav|He should be a great asset.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_249.wav|It means they actually control the programme.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_250.wav|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?|77,,
wav48/p308/p308_251.wav|We are not out of touch with politics.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_252.wav|We could have got three medals.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_253.wav|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_254.wav|We are at a crossroads.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_255.wav|We are satisfied with this outcome.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_256.wav|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_257.wav|It didn't take long.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_258.wav|This meeting is the path to salvation.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_259.wav|Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_260.wav|I started on fire a couple of times.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_261.wav|He also received a medal of honour.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_262.wav|It's not one for the purists.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_263.wav|She said he showed no remorse.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_264.wav|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.|77,,
wav48/p308/p308_265.wav|We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_266.wav|It is a time bomb.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_267.wav|It's a matter of huge concern.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_268.wav|Harrowing is easy, after all.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_269.wav|Three years probation is just a joke.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_270.wav|The outstanding issues are still there.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_271.wav|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_272.wav|I'm not sure how they got there, but they are.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_273.wav|And that's good news for the magpies.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_274.wav|He always has been, since his early days with Scottish Opera.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_275.wav|That got me out of jail.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_276.wav|We've turned the corner.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_277.wav|This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.|77,,
wav48/p308/p308_278.wav|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_279.wav|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.|77,,
wav48/p308/p308_280.wav|However, the move was bitterly criticised last night.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_281.wav|We've taken steps to rectify it.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_282.wav|I see no need for change.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_283.wav|Do yourselves a favour.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_284.wav|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_285.wav|Others said they had been beaten by police.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_286.wav|The new system will be marketed this summer.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_287.wav|I'd love to be like Peter.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_288.wav|Then came the collision with Sergio.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_289.wav|We also hope to meet the Ulster Unionists.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_290.wav|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_291.wav|His is a success story by any standard.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_292.wav|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_293.wav|I shall be voting Yes to support him.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_294.wav|Is something which we just don't do.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_295.wav|We work on the same level.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_296.wav|I've got a young family.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_297.wav|I'm trying to stay open on that.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_298.wav|It all seemed so easy.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_299.wav|I really don't understand what is happening.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_300.wav|The frustration was showing.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_301.wav|Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_302.wav|I am a wealthy person.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_303.wav|My friends were very envious.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_304.wav|The snipers are also out.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_305.wav|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_306.wav|We're determined to establish the facts.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_307.wav|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_308.wav|The list is too long for this piece.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_309.wav|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_310.wav|Entries for the event are still being accepted.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_311.wav|It plans to return to this field.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_312.wav|However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.|77,
wav48/p308/p308_313.wav|To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_314.wav|Tonight's matches European Championship.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_315.wav|It's like the Russians.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_316.wav|Is that Titanic?|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_317.wav|Let us hope so.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_318.wav|So, the question is, is it any good?|77,,
wav48/p308/p308_319.wav|I'm getting back up there now.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_320.wav|I couldn't see any reason not to die.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_321.wav|My players have no idea about football.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_322.wav|They are there to get people into work.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_323.wav|I'm getting long in the tooth.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_324.wav|They would be wise to do just that.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_325.wav|Strathclyde Police yesterday declined to comment on Ferris.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_326.wav|Some old favourites remain in varying forms.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_327.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.|77,,
wav48/p308/p308_328.wav|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_329.wav|She had gone to the Catholic school.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_330.wav|Then we will face the Danish champions.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_331.wav|I'd go to bookshops.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_332.wav|It is time to fight a decisive battle.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_333.wav|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.|77,,
wav48/p308/p308_334.wav|Its national defence policy is defensive in nature.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_335.wav|Military chiefs were playing it straight.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_336.wav|Adams is surely worth a chance.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_337.wav|There was no hint of bravado.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_338.wav|You've been a great audience.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_339.wav|ADVENTURE is the champagne of life.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_340.wav|By then, however, both men were already in the US.|77,,
wav48/p308/p308_341.wav|She's a valuable member of the Government.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_342.wav|I just need a bit of luck.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_343.wav|The feedback from audiences was just so positive.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_344.wav|I always felt they played for me.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_345.wav|Again, it's about responding to your resources.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_346.wav|Managers and clinicians must work together.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_347.wav|The princess has had other health problems.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_348.wav|Everything else is a bonus.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_349.wav|The hotel was now for sale.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_350.wav|There are two games to go after that.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_351.wav|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_352.wav|His replacement was named yesterday, following inquiries by The Herald.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_353.wav|Investment in quality, service and marketing were the only way forward.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_354.wav|She now suffers from multiple sclerosis.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_355.wav|It was a UK-wide report.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_356.wav|This is a dreadful day for Iona.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_357.wav|He spoke about the choices facing them, and their country.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_358.wav|It could be done by experts and lawyers.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_359.wav|The discussions will surely not last too long.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_360.wav|We'll talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_361.wav|They have not let anyone into the loop.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_362.wav|So just what is her enduring appeal?|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_363.wav|It's not easy to live in Russia.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_364.wav|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_365.wav|Last night was a key episode.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_366.wav|I grew up listening to these people.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_367.wav|It is normal for me.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_368.wav|But it may not be all bad news.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_369.wav|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_370.wav|I am content with the silver.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_371.wav|We have fun in our lives.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_372.wav|This, too, could prove a risky business.|77,,
wav48/p308/p308_373.wav|You have to audition for jobs.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_374.wav|We're not comparing like with like.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_375.wav|Ferguson should take note.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_376.wav|We have always been, and remain confident of securing the order.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_377.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_378.wav|They've got three-quarters of the way.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_379.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.|77,,
wav48/p308/p308_380.wav|She was released from hospital yesterday.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_381.wav|That is not just my personal view.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_382.wav|The move follows a review of the Singapore|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_383.wav|It's like a garage.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_384.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_385.wav|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_386.wav|Liberal Democrat leader makes a hash of it.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_387.wav|You just have to accept.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_388.wav|We've got to get it right.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_389.wav|The trouble is, though, that there is no simple solution.|77,,
wav48/p308/p308_390.wav|His death was a tragic accident.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_391.wav|Would you take them?|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_392.wav|I find it puzzling and disturbing.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_393.wav|He lost his job, but it was not just a job.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_394.wav|His condition was stable last night.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_395.wav|I'd never seen a play about me.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_396.wav|At present it is fairly uncommon, but its incidence is increasing.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_397.wav|The report is due out next month.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_398.wav|It was nerve-racking to watch.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_399.wav|It remains in public ownership.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_400.wav|The Master was by then just too old.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_401.wav|All credit to them, they took their chances, we didn't.|77,,
wav48/p308/p308_402.wav|Sub Not Used, McArthur.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_403.wav|It's a very high number.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_404.wav|I leave tonight for England.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_405.wav|She didn't tell me anything the night before.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_406.wav|This is a thoroughly handsome and enjoyable production.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_407.wav|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_408.wav|He was dead on arrival at hospital.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_409.wav|I have no argument with Scotland.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_410.wav|There are simply no orders.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_411.wav|Sutton is playing as well as ever today.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_412.wav|Like anyone else, he has to take his time.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_413.wav|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_414.wav|The problem in Norway is outside the National.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_415.wav|She took them for a term.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_416.wav|I haven't spoken to anyone about that, not even my wife.|77,,,
wav48/p308/p308_417.wav|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_418.wav|Or so she thought.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_419.wav|It was another good idea.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_420.wav|This would discourage investment and job creation.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_421.wav|The Foreign Office was conspicuous by its absence.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_422.wav|Last night they were being comforted by relatives.|77,,,,
wav48/p308/p308_423.wav|In fact, they should have scored three times.|77,,,
wav48/p310/p310_001.wav|Please call Stella.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|78,,
wav48/p310/p310_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes the raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and these two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|78,,
wav48/p310/p310_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|78,,
wav48/p310/p310_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which gods passed from earth to the home in the skies.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|78,,
wav48/p310/p310_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|78,,
wav48/p310/p310_025.wav|He was the youngest of the British team.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_026.wav|I fell in love with the ballet.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_027.wav|That their music is truly, truly, truly great.|78,,
wav48/p310/p310_028.wav|It feels like a winner already.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_029.wav|Did you see that?|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_030.wav|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_031.wav|And the winners are.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_032.wav|I can't believe something like this could happen.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_033.wav|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.|78,,
wav48/p310/p310_034.wav|He didn't really, we just made that up.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_035.wav|Scotland has lost a great religious leader.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_036.wav|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.|78,,
wav48/p310/p310_037.wav|It is easy to be wise in hindsight.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_038.wav|We're still talking with a few people.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_039.wav|But one shouldn't go by that.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_040.wav|Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_041.wav|Buying our way out is not an option.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_042.wav|There are big names.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_043.wav|That argument has been won.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_044.wav|Normally, they have been a pack of lies.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_045.wav|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_046.wav|And who would argue with that?|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_047.wav|I hope you will leave it at that.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_048.wav|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_049.wav|They had four children together.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_050.wav|Again, that was genuine loyalty being recognised.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_051.wav|Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_052.wav|I fell to the ground.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_053.wav|They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_054.wav|They were not defeated.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_055.wav|Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.|78,,
wav48/p310/p310_056.wav|How can they engage with the work?|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_057.wav|All of us know it exists.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_058.wav|Moray Council could not be contacted last night.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_059.wav|This is the band.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_060.wav|She has a wonderful mind.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_061.wav|There are just two tournaments remaining.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_062.wav|We're into that build-up now.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_063.wav|It is the end of an era.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_064.wav|We shall not do that.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_065.wav|I have had no social life at all.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_066.wav|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_067.wav|Once again, he refused.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_068.wav|This is about the Orange Order.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_069.wav|In fact, they will not be disciplined.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_070.wav|We're not the tourist board.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_071.wav|Sub Not Used, McKenzie.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_072.wav|Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_073.wav|The Commons is too outdated.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_074.wav|Overall, though, it has been a pretty good week.|78,,
wav48/p310/p310_075.wav|That was then and this is now.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_076.wav|Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_077.wav|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_078.wav|Are you watching Liverpool?|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_079.wav|He would be with his peers.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_080.wav|They seem to be backing off from that.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_081.wav|But it took a lot of bottle.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_082.wav|They don't work anymore anyway.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_083.wav|I wish they, too, would get a grip.|78,,
wav48/p310/p310_084.wav|I am so sorry.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_085.wav|This avalanche is just beginning.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_086.wav|Journalists should make him.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_087.wav|I believe we have a good chance.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_088.wav|However, it is no longer with the national team.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_089.wav|She may even appear in some more films.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_090.wav|This is the best moment of my career.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_091.wav|He also called in at another farm.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_092.wav|I don't know why she is not here.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_093.wav|England could not take anything for granted, however.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_094.wav|I agree with them.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_095.wav|I feel very strongly about that.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_096.wav|Now he will have to start again.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_097.wav|It is a difficult thing to explain.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_098.wav|I don't know how it happened.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_099.wav|Peter doesn't want to leave.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_100.wav|After that nothing could save him.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_101.wav|Construction is due to begin in February.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_102.wav|We shall rely on human beings.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_103.wav|In fact, that would be a distortion of the truth.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_104.wav|He wouldn't allow that to happen.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_105.wav|His treatment has been quite atrocious.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_106.wav|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_107.wav|Or, rather, it isn't.|78,,
wav48/p310/p310_108.wav|The picture is the same across Scotland.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_109.wav|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_110.wav|My dad was working in Ayrshire.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_111.wav|There are lots of these women in Finland.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_112.wav|I will not be in dialogue with her.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_113.wav|But there is another side.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_114.wav|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_115.wav|There is no guarantee.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_116.wav|I'm confident we can turn things around.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_117.wav|We want to get to the final, anyway.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_118.wav|It may be argued.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_119.wav|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_120.wav|I bought a car at auction.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_121.wav|And who were they anyway, beforehand?|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_122.wav|His three-year appointment begins on Monday.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_123.wav|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_124.wav|Five in a month isn't good enough.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_125.wav|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_126.wav|This is just one example.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_127.wav|Both offices were closed yesterday.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_128.wav|They don't have to, but they normally do.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_129.wav|We stopped at half-time.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_130.wav|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.|78,,
wav48/p310/p310_131.wav|David was not either.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_132.wav|Britain may now be forced to listen.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_133.wav|We don't see it as downgrading.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_134.wav|He wanted someone young and ambitious.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_135.wav|No date has been set for the appeal.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_136.wav|He is dying from cancer.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_137.wav|People can describe a moment in their life.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_138.wav|What's the rush?|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_139.wav|The starting point is pretty unusual.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_140.wav|However, they will only be found in the wild.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_141.wav|They receive a high profile in the media.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_142.wav|It was an ambush.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_143.wav|I think this proposal is excellent.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_144.wav|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_145.wav|Is that too much to ask?|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_146.wav|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_147.wav|I've so much respect for him.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_148.wav|Each one has its own system.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_149.wav|I felt under no pressure today.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_150.wav|The Devil is the creator of weapons.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_151.wav|And that was the adults.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_152.wav|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.|78,,
wav48/p310/p310_153.wav|This is a job for the Government.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_154.wav|I felt the head was very like me.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_155.wav|We started with that.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_156.wav|And he had much need.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_157.wav|Last night the bombardment was terrible.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_158.wav|This can only help us go forward.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_159.wav|It's never the same problem.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_160.wav|But, even so, you always want to try something new.|78,,
wav48/p310/p310_161.wav|Jonny Wilkinson had an off-day on Saturday.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_162.wav|I hadn't been looking after myself.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_163.wav|I was over the moon.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_164.wav|And really, the songs are the key thing.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_165.wav|Four minutes later, the show was over.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_166.wav|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_167.wav|Northern Ireland is a society divided by religion.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_168.wav|And then came the seventies.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_169.wav|I guess it is down to focus.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_170.wav|Last week, he was taken to the hospital.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_171.wav|You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_172.wav|His track record is not promising.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_173.wav|No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.|78,,
wav48/p310/p310_174.wav|He put a lot of effort into it.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_175.wav|However, you have just got to adjust it.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_176.wav|That was moving the goalposts.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_177.wav|He was pronounced dead in hospital.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_178.wav|We have the location, which is assured.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_179.wav|The club are feeling no different today.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_180.wav|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?|78,,
wav48/p310/p310_181.wav|I see the extended family once a year.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_182.wav|I'm not a magician.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_183.wav|We couldn't go very fast.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_185.wav|There was even a joke.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_186.wav|Tony Blair, can you see her face?|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_187.wav|This guy is never going to give up.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_188.wav|They had previously been on five-day notice.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_189.wav|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_190.wav|The show is small but perfectly formed.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_191.wav|This is the first job of the director - leadership.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_192.wav|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.|78,,
wav48/p310/p310_193.wav|It is too early to speculate.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_194.wav|I just had so much fun.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_195.wav|Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_196.wav|I will wait until later.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_197.wav|Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_198.wav|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.|78,,
wav48/p310/p310_199.wav|Or so we have long assumed.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_200.wav|They responded with victories.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_201.wav|That was the personal impulse.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_202.wav|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.|78,,
wav48/p310/p310_203.wav|But first it goes out on TV.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_204.wav|What is the truth about the cow?|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_205.wav|They will want to watch a winning team.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_206.wav|I think it's awful.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_207.wav|Who is going to be penalised?|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_208.wav|This will be just another tax on motorists.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_209.wav|I feel sorry for the Reds.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_210.wav|One must hope not!|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_211.wav|He is a Satan.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_212.wav|Just see where the blood is coming from.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_213.wav|He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_214.wav|In her opinion, the rich are different.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_215.wav|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_216.wav|I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_217.wav|There was no cohesion.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_218.wav|He was jailed for five years.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_219.wav|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_220.wav|We will not break even.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_221.wav|We will look into it.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_222.wav|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_223.wav|But he's not afraid to take risks.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_224.wav|Some of his family still live there.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_225.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_226.wav|However, it very nearly went wrong.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_227.wav|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_228.wav|Things are moving together.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_229.wav|I get to work with very good people.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_230.wav|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_231.wav|He must not be removed from office.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_232.wav|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.|78,,
wav48/p310/p310_233.wav|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_234.wav|Look at the table.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_235.wav|This film will be totally awesome.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_236.wav|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_237.wav|Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_238.wav|Last year was not a good year.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_239.wav|It's a difficult job.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_240.wav|We can't get over it.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_241.wav|Several hundred people attended yesterday.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_242.wav|My preference is for the single vaccines.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_243.wav|This represents a tough game for us.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_244.wav|He saw it all as a big game.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_245.wav|They are not an item.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_246.wav|And thought we would get away with it.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_247.wav|I can't wait for the outdoors.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_248.wav|It's more like a Labour Party rally.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_249.wav|Staff should be paid for what they produce.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_250.wav|I would urge the Government to think again.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_251.wav|It will be even more difficult tomorrow.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_252.wav|They were on holiday in Egypt.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_253.wav|I was happiest with my short game.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_254.wav|We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_255.wav|We went on to become very successful.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_256.wav|Investment in quality, service and marketing were the only way forward.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_257.wav|No, is the answer to your first question.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_258.wav|We certainly did enough to win it, but didn't.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_259.wav|That could be at least five years away.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_260.wav|That is my role.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_261.wav|He also presented You Bet!|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_262.wav|That's the day job.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_263.wav|It really is taken seriously.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_264.wav|We have not given up hope.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_265.wav|I'm looking at ways to do that now.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_266.wav|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_267.wav|It's such a trial!|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_268.wav|That kind of growth is the important thing.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_269.wav|I think it is totally wrong.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_270.wav|And a film maker was born.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_271.wav|It was also put on the Internet.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_272.wav|The reason is the thought of Olympic gold.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_273.wav|And yet his legacy is doubtful.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_274.wav|It seems to have worked.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_275.wav|Top-up fees are not on the agenda.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_276.wav|There was a battle there.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_277.wav|This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.|78,,
wav48/p310/p310_278.wav|Well, when did he ever refuse?|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_279.wav|Today's ruling confirms that.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_280.wav|It's good news and long overdue.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_281.wav|THE atmosphere was electric.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_282.wav|I'd never heard him in person before.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_283.wav|We're going to change our party.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_284.wav|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_285.wav|I have learned a lot from him.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_286.wav|Is he any good in the kitchen?|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_287.wav|He has been campaigning for change for years.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_288.wav|A formal decision will be announced within months.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_289.wav|He must have something up his sleeve.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_290.wav|He was at home with his pals.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_291.wav|We make good weapons.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_292.wav|So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_293.wav|This is not a Scottish problem.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_294.wav|Then followed a bout of flu.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_295.wav|The balance isn't there at EMI.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_296.wav|That was the most annoying thing.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_297.wav|We are being hijacked.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_298.wav|We had no part in it.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_299.wav|It wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_300.wav|Mike Tyson went to prison.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_301.wav|It was nice to get a clean sheet.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_302.wav|Our young people are leaving.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_303.wav|And there is no cause for it.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_304.wav|That would have been too easy.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_305.wav|She admitted the theft of letters and deception.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_306.wav|This is not a faceless system.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_307.wav|This is a long-term discussion paper.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_308.wav|In all cases computer equipment was seized.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_309.wav|It is just like the stock market.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_310.wav|The damage from the fire was huge.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_311.wav|That's what it's all about, isn't it?|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_312.wav|Both agreed on the success of the event.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_313.wav|What, then, is the real thing?|78,,
wav48/p310/p310_314.wav|Boarding school was equally protective.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_315.wav|Most people know that.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_316.wav|It will be the final push.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_317.wav|Clearly, this was the important nursing.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_318.wav|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_319.wav|The campaign was raucous.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_320.wav|On Saturday, it was much the same.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_321.wav|But both were involved with other matters.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_322.wav|But we were wrong.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_323.wav|The result today is an impasse.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_324.wav|However, in October another partnership was announced.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_325.wav|There is no threat to them.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_326.wav|Nelson does not disappoint.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_327.wav|The goal will stay with me forever.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_328.wav|The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_329.wav|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_330.wav|It is a high time to act.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_331.wav|Then we will face the Danish champions.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_332.wav|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.|78,
wav48/p310/p310_333.wav|The South African defended his work ethic.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_334.wav|We have a team to reach the final.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_335.wav|There was barely a handful of chances.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_336.wav|The Olympic committee should be ashamed of themselves.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_337.wav|I have found my vision.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_338.wav|We don't know the scale of need.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_339.wav|You need a reason for staying.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_340.wav|Quite simply, for once in his life, he got it wrong.|78,,
wav48/p310/p310_341.wav|However, we have not come to any conclusions.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_342.wav|I don't expect to see that this time.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_343.wav|You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_344.wav|The big issue for us is the review.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_345.wav|That is not the way we should operate.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_346.wav|More likely, perhaps, it is that he will stay in England.|78,,
wav48/p310/p310_347.wav|The new work will begin in the autumn.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_348.wav|The written judgment was issued in printed form.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_349.wav|He showed he has some things to learn.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_350.wav|Or do they?|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_351.wav|They are the innocent victims.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_352.wav|It is now time for justice.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_353.wav|That is of no use.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_354.wav|I could have been offended.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_355.wav|Now it is measuring it in dollars.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_356.wav|But he is frustrated at every turn.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_357.wav|He was down the right, the left, and through the middle.|78,,
wav48/p310/p310_358.wav|This is the lowest of the low.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_359.wav|Brian Wilson, in case you didn't know, is a genius.|78,,
wav48/p310/p310_360.wav|Clearly, it is time to meet this young man.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_361.wav|He's a nice guy.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_362.wav|The milk industry is in turmoil.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_363.wav|I love the moment of being first.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_364.wav|It is a decision which has paid off.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_365.wav|Their mind was already made up.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_366.wav|I had some time with Aston Villa.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_367.wav|But it's got to be worth it.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_368.wav|But does the same thing happen with music?|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_369.wav|I just couldn't believe what had happened.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_370.wav|Alex is a big part of that future.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_371.wav|Pray that is so.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_372.wav|In fact it isn't related to either.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_373.wav|There was support from across the board.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_374.wav|There may be some evidence to this effect.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_375.wav|It is playing long, but it is also in beautiful condition.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_376.wav|So what does one do?|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_377.wav|Such actions are rarely popular.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_378.wav|The methadone programme is completely out of control.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_379.wav|That is why it's so lyrical.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_380.wav|I joined a group.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_381.wav|I've heard this stuff about the markets.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_382.wav|It has the Bank of Scotland behind it.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_383.wav|It has removed a bit of guilt.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_384.wav|And they all had these other commitments.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_385.wav|However, there you have it, success has eluded them so far.|78,,
wav48/p310/p310_386.wav|Here, again, they were denied a voice.|78,,
wav48/p310/p310_387.wav|They were unconfirmed reports that it was a cannabis.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_388.wav|Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.|78,,
wav48/p310/p310_389.wav|I never agreed with that.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_390.wav|I didn't actually believe them at first.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_391.wav|Have you heard anything from Paramount?|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_392.wav|We knew their goalkeeper would take the chance.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_393.wav|We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_394.wav|There was only one hole in it.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_395.wav|I don't think it's vital.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_396.wav|It might not survive the process.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_397.wav|They keep the atmosphere in mind.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_398.wav|My father died in childbirth.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_399.wav|The issue has still to be resolved.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_400.wav|Which brings us to the Scottish connection.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_401.wav|It is a catalogue of obstruction.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_402.wav|I'm happy to contribute to that.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_403.wav|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_404.wav|We were close, but not close enough.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_405.wav|And that started me thinking.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_406.wav|Offered the gold medal, he declined.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_407.wav|It brings together two essential elements.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_408.wav|Is it the players, or is it the coaches?|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_409.wav|We had a reunion last week.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_410.wav|This will help our confidence.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_411.wav|We have high hopes that this will work.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_412.wav|They also have good neighbours.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_413.wav|People ask about the concept of a team.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_414.wav|Who has he fought?|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_415.wav|The film is about the cost of genius.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_416.wav|They've been here before.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_417.wav|I want a free vote.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_418.wav|He came close to signing for Rangers, too.|78,,,
wav48/p310/p310_419.wav|It would show them a positive way forward.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_420.wav|I think it's a disgrace.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_421.wav|So he should be.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_422.wav|He also admitted possessing a firearm.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_423.wav|ALL IS busy but not much is happening.|78,,,,
wav48/p310/p310_424.wav|Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.|78,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_001.wav|Please call Stella.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|79,,
wav48/p311/p311_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|79,,
wav48/p311/p311_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|79,,
wav48/p311/p311_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|79,,
wav48/p311/p311_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|79,,
wav48/p311/p311_025.wav|No sooner had we got it, than we wanted it different.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_026.wav|It's ahead of Labour.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_027.wav|It is the whole package.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_028.wav|I was totally wrong.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_029.wav|It was a matter of chance.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_030.wav|Strictly speaking, it shouldn't be like this.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_031.wav|Miller was every bit as happy.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_032.wav|We keep a distance.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_033.wav|She went home from school and never returned.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_034.wav|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_035.wav|With actors it is slightly different.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_036.wav|Green is desperate to play in The Open.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_037.wav|They did a very good job.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_038.wav|That's what we're still trying to do.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_039.wav|He tried to stop it, but it was already too late.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_040.wav|We cannot go on in this fashion.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_041.wav|We must learn to finish.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_042.wav|There can be no two ways about it.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_043.wav|I knew my contract was up this year.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_044.wav|I am content with the silver.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_045.wav|People acted too quickly.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_046.wav|My heart is with the artist.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_047.wav|That fight begins today for freedom and liberty.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_048.wav|There are different cultures in different departments.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_049.wav|What would you do if you didn't work?|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_050.wav|They are already on the way there.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_051.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_052.wav|This is a holy place.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_053.wav|We will miss him very much.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_054.wav|As a nation, we must become more active.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_055.wav|They should go ahead as normal.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_056.wav|At the moment, Michael is in a class of his own.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_057.wav|It ended as it began, in confusion.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_058.wav|I just went a bit too far.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_059.wav|I am delighted for Simon.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_060.wav|His third goal was superb.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_061.wav|I don't have a problem with getting older.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_062.wav|It has been declared.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_063.wav|Sure, that already happens in New Zealand.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_064.wav|The scientific debate is dead.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_065.wav|Only one got through.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_066.wav|In the end, however, it all came together.|79,,
wav48/p311/p311_067.wav|He is a visionary.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_068.wav|I was the trial judge in both.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_069.wav|I have a choice.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_070.wav|It happens in many countries.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_071.wav|It's not just about the shows.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_072.wav|But the cost to his health was enormous.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_073.wav|I have spoken to the skipper.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_074.wav|Already the children are dying.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_075.wav|Craig is a major concern for us.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_076.wav|We don't do this for everyone, of course.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_077.wav|I can't wait to meet him.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_078.wav|THE pain was almost too much to bear.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_079.wav|It's the same as Glasgow.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_080.wav|We've got a job to do.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_081.wav|You just have to adjust.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_082.wav|Well, that's just a third district.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_083.wav|I've done nothing wrong, and that's the truth.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_084.wav|They are there to help us.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_085.wav|He added, We are not prepared for war.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_086.wav|My wife and family are the support system.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_087.wav|Sub Not Used, McArthur.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_088.wav|I have hardly any commitments.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_089.wav|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_090.wav|It is a very special place.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_091.wav|Some things in life you have to accept.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_092.wav|I am relishing the challenge.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_093.wav|It is set in Paris.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_094.wav|The party has never fully recovered.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_095.wav|Everyone is working together to resolve the problems.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_096.wav|Surely history will not repeat itself.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_097.wav|The initial report has been completed.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_098.wav|He's got me very well.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_099.wav|It's like an extension of your body.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_100.wav|It is quite a new prescription.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_101.wav|Johnsen is equally concerned.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_102.wav|Which he is, too.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_103.wav|These matters are now behind us.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_104.wav|But things are never the same again.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_105.wav|It is easy to agree with him.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_106.wav|He, too, will return.|79,,
wav48/p311/p311_107.wav|Is there anything in the wound?|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_108.wav|Chambers said he would accept the place.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_109.wav|Just watch the videos and you'll see it.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_110.wav|It is not really used by many people.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_111.wav|There could be no dispute about our history.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_112.wav|He has one son and one daughter.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_113.wav|Don't get me wrong.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_114.wav|It is nearly there.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_115.wav|Otherwise we will pay the price.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_116.wav|I find it rather oppressive.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_117.wav|They are all Arabs.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_118.wav|It is already making a difference.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_119.wav|He decides to do something about it.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_120.wav|There were no new cases yesterday.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_121.wav|Someone else has now got them.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_122.wav|But once again it was not converted.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_123.wav|These figures are truly terrible.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_124.wav|This is a most serious matter.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_125.wav|I let go the telephone and ran.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_126.wav|Everyone at the school is delighted for Steven.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_127.wav|After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_128.wav|It was a bit of a shock.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_129.wav|The hearing was continued until a later date.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_130.wav|Still, some additions are inspired.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_131.wav|Planning is a key issue.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_132.wav|Did he always want to be a comedian?|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_133.wav|The way ahead is not easy.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_134.wav|I could do a better job.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_135.wav|Yet what is supposed to be said?|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_136.wav|Parole isn't a decision for me.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_137.wav|I get the bus.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_138.wav|We are still the best team in Britain.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_139.wav|They got the job done.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_140.wav|It's a horrific incident.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_141.wav|They have been contrasting years, certainly.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_142.wav|Four minutes later, the show was over.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_143.wav|We've not won anything yet.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_144.wav|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_145.wav|There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_146.wav|They did not let him down.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_147.wav|I believe in trade unions.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_148.wav|This is in a league of its own.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_149.wav|It's been such a waste of money.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_150.wav|The money is not really our concern.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_151.wav|You just know it.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_152.wav|Now, she has completed a family tradition.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_153.wav|I certainly think it's very short-sighted.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_154.wav|We have the easy part.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_155.wav|At Westminster, there was disbelief at the news.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_156.wav|It's like a high school play.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_157.wav|He was part of South Africa.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_158.wav|It's there for people to look at.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_159.wav|The party will make up its own mind.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_160.wav|At least two women were among those arrested.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_161.wav|They never got into the show this time.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_162.wav|But no, it's not funny.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_163.wav|In that case, the children were not missing.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_164.wav|He changed my life.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_165.wav|There was nothing else to match it.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_166.wav|Two options are being proposed.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_167.wav|They haven't been thought through.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_168.wav|The criteria have changed.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_169.wav|O, Is there a lot of blood?|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_170.wav|Willie deserved it, for what he has achieved.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_171.wav|I've thought a lot about the Commonwealths.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_172.wav|He was at home with his pals.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_173.wav|This is a very interesting move.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_174.wav|The highest rate is in Glasgow.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_175.wav|His only reply was a laugh.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_176.wav|those who are preparing to give up.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_177.wav|What kind of festival is proposed?|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_178.wav|I was delighted with every one of them.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_179.wav|Sure the COE is a cracking band.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_180.wav|Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_181.wav|That will help my case a bit.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_182.wav|It was entirely justified.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_183.wav|He looked at me before replying.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_184.wav|This may be perfectly innocent.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_185.wav|It feels that the game is off.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_186.wav|There will be no change in government.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_187.wav|Another man said, It was horrible.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_188.wav|But we still don't know.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_189.wav|Who do you think you are?|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_190.wav|Glasgow is a tour de force.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_191.wav|I have no battle with the Scots.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_192.wav|It is all credit to them today.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_193.wav|I have done ever since it was published.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_194.wav|Nobody could survive on that.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_195.wav|They seem to turn up for them.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_196.wav|They were kept there for a summer.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_197.wav|He confirmed there had been no warning.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_198.wav|It is that sort of film.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_199.wav|She was not hard done by.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_200.wav|Can you believe it?|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_201.wav|I want the Commonwealth and European titles.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_202.wav|They are now out in the cold.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_203.wav|However, planners should be taking the lead.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_204.wav|I'm very frightened of the dark.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_205.wav|Our message was inclusive.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_206.wav|This has been a shock.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_207.wav|Yet the survey has been cautious.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_208.wav|Everything in the symphony is there.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_209.wav|There has also been some Scots input.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_210.wav|This time, he will be more on the defensive.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_211.wav|There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_212.wav|But who will buy it?|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_213.wav|It had to be more flexible.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_214.wav|Openness is always the best way.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_215.wav|It wouldn't go off.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_216.wav|It can be halted.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_217.wav|This was a lot of numbers.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_218.wav|Would it be good for the Nationwide League?|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_219.wav|Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_220.wav|The whole thing has been a nightmare.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_221.wav|He denied that he was an absentee landlord.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_222.wav|The professor said the results were positive.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_223.wav|I think he's the favourite, no question.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_224.wav|But it's just great to have won.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_225.wav|And it paid off.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_226.wav|Gone with them is any sense of narrative.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_227.wav|Those Were The Days, indeed.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_228.wav|I never made any offer to Mark.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_229.wav|It should be scrapped.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_230.wav|He admitted the asylum system was not working.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_231.wav|They are just trying to cover up.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_232.wav|We have to defend ourselves.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_233.wav|I came here this week to work.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_234.wav|Where do we go from here?|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_235.wav|Barry Ferguson is one of them.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_236.wav|He gets his moment.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_237.wav|This was an option from the beginning.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_238.wav|Clearly he is keeping in touch.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_239.wav|It's not a party, no, no.|79,,
wav48/p311/p311_240.wav|It's not that clear-cut.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_241.wav|It may not be life long.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_242.wav|It was just above the roof.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_243.wav|It has changed, and not for the better.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_244.wav|However, that is a sizeable if.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_245.wav|Everyone must be focused on the league.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_246.wav|The English are coming.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_247.wav|I believe in theatre.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_248.wav|Only four of his passengers were uninjured.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_249.wav|However, many of their victories have been close affairs.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_250.wav|It's time to say enough is enough.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_251.wav|Mentally, you have to be tough.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_252.wav|He has to pull back from the brink.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_253.wav|She has insisted she did nothing wrong.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_254.wav|That's my daughter acting.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_255.wav|The film has also been superbly designed.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_256.wav|The performance was really, really immense.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_257.wav|Faces from the Eighties.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_258.wav|The family baton is handed on.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_259.wav|How can this be?|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_260.wav|We are still alive and kicking.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_261.wav|I want to go now.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_262.wav|There are many questions to be answered.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_263.wav|Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_264.wav|All the children on the roll are genuine.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_265.wav|They said we were out of touch.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_266.wav|Sub Not Used, McCormick.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_267.wav|There is no signature.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_268.wav|There is no point in denying that.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_269.wav|The kids are paying the price.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_270.wav|He said he was delighted by the award.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_271.wav|They didn't find any substance.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_272.wav|They still have the dirty work to do.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_273.wav|I've never seen a game like it.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_274.wav|It doesn't seem like that long ago.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_275.wav|He will do very well.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_276.wav|They also intend to travel today.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_277.wav|There's a lot of hysteria.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_278.wav|The casualties were not named.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_279.wav|I was shaking on the blocks.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_280.wav|There are two ways to start a festival.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_281.wav|I am very happy with life.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_282.wav|Awareness in Europe of Scotland is high.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_283.wav|My office is down there.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_284.wav|Even then this game was not over.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_285.wav|Seaman is not a goalkeeper of old.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_286.wav|We also hope to meet the men.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_287.wav|The defender made an impressive debut.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_288.wav|It has become very confused.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_289.wav|Fame and money followed.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_290.wav|I am not in denial.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_291.wav|Shelter also supports the reform.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_292.wav|The attack was totally out of the blue.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_293.wav|There is a solution, she believes.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_294.wav|So there is a very real dilemma.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_295.wav|I can't believe we didn't win that game.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_296.wav|Then there's the Old Firm.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_297.wav|I seem to keep this for the majors.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_298.wav|We were in different places, usually in cellars.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_299.wav|They're not always the same person.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_300.wav|It would have to be backdated.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_301.wav|He said he was sorry.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_302.wav|My position on the euro is quite clear.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_303.wav|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.|79,,
wav48/p311/p311_304.wav|We have worked well with them for years.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_305.wav|That was me today.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_306.wav|That is the consistent approach of the Government.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_307.wav|That is when we are really effective.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_308.wav|The director's a genius.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_309.wav|There was no sign that anything was amiss.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_310.wav|It was the climax of the thing.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_311.wav|This is new money.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_312.wav|We have not given up on the game.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_313.wav|The decision was left entirely to him.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_314.wav|Yes, it was uplifting.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_315.wav|Nobody should believe this story.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_316.wav|This is not out of choice.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_317.wav|But don't just take my word, for it.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_318.wav|But this one has a lot of potential.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_319.wav|It's a big challenge for the audience.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_320.wav|We'll see what happens.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_321.wav|This was another video cassette.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_322.wav|If that is the perception, that has to be addressed.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_323.wav|It will make a huge difference.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_324.wav|He pretended not to care.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_325.wav|Not because they want to sing about something.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_326.wav|I was in tears in the street.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_327.wav|Eriksson, though, was having none of it.|79,,
wav48/p311/p311_328.wav|No doubt the council would welcome the proposal.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_329.wav|But that's not the idea behind this article.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_330.wav|If he could've prevented it happening, he would have.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_331.wav|That is why we are here.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_332.wav|The German had a point to make.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_333.wav|This time, however, may have been different.|79,,
wav48/p311/p311_334.wav|You have to feel for the guy.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_335.wav|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_336.wav|Bomber was not amused.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_337.wav|They would have been forgiven for doing so.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_338.wav|Was it just negligent.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_339.wav|And suddenly it became a free-for-all.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_340.wav|This Government is cutting taxes.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_341.wav|Things don't look too good at the moment.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_342.wav|This is a big club.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_343.wav|I couldn't quite believe it, and still can't.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_344.wav|They will now get that support.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_345.wav|I feel it's time to make the switch.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_346.wav|It seemed so personal.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_347.wav|I've no problem with what they said.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_348.wav|He added that he felt undermined.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_349.wav|I think we have got the balance right.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_350.wav|Eriksson would have approved.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_351.wav|It is physical but it is also good.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_352.wav|His behaviour today has been disgusting.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_353.wav|Tyson said he had made a mistake.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_354.wav|So it goes on.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_355.wav|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_356.wav|I hope they will understand the reasons.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_357.wav|They should have listened to me.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_358.wav|I am greatly encouraged.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_359.wav|It was like someone had died.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_360.wav|What does he want him to look like?|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_361.wav|The actors are confident and polished.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_362.wav|I hope he would have been very pleased.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_363.wav|We would have concerns about that.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_364.wav|Taxes may need to rise.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_365.wav|It's unusual to say the least.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_366.wav|All inquiries should be made to the police.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_367.wav|Our Great Depression is our lives.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_368.wav|I just did not cope with the pressure.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_369.wav|We have some concerns.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_370.wav|So he was anxious to try something new.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_371.wav|This was a chilling echo.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_372.wav|They really want to do it.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_373.wav|And then he laughs.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_374.wav|I recommend a tour.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_375.wav|We don't ask for much.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_376.wav|We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_377.wav|I had a wonderful time working with him.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_378.wav|We have to start again on Saturday.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_379.wav|It feels like a winner already.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_380.wav|And it covers the spectrum.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_381.wav|The replacements made a big difference.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_382.wav|And the winners are.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_383.wav|Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_384.wav|He didn't really, we just made that up.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_385.wav|Scotland has lost a great religious leader.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_386.wav|There are big names.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_387.wav|My players are precious to me.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_388.wav|That argument has been won.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_389.wav|Normally, they have been a pack of lies.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_390.wav|For us, that decision was hard to understand.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_391.wav|I had to calm down.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_392.wav|Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_393.wav|She returned home a few days later.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_394.wav|They haven't run away.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_395.wav|Nobody can take it away from me.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_396.wav|She is fulfilled by it.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_397.wav|He said no survivors had been found.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_398.wav|Who can say?|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_399.wav|It is the end of an era.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_400.wav|In short, the club was broke.|79,,,
wav48/p311/p311_401.wav|Sadly, in this case, that was not so.|79,,
wav48/p311/p311_402.wav|She is a veteran in the Balkans.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_403.wav|The men are safe and unharmed.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_404.wav|We're not the tourist board.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_405.wav|It was the same old story.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_406.wav|I was frustrated here.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_407.wav|We have reacted well to each other.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_408.wav|Are you watching Liverpool?|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_409.wav|I was furious about it.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_410.wav|This will be no easy option.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_411.wav|They knew they shouldn't have been there.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_412.wav|Of course we aren't.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_413.wav|We haven't been told.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_414.wav|It worked well in Monaco.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_415.wav|They were outside the circle.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_416.wav|The whole process was so different.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_417.wav|He also called in at another farm.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_418.wav|I agree with them.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_419.wav|I feel very strongly about that.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_420.wav|We will listen to colleagues.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_421.wav|It's very difficult and very worrying.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_422.wav|It's something we want to make work.|79,,,,
wav48/p311/p311_423.wav|There will be no excuses on Wednesday.|79,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|80,,
wav48/p312/p312_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|80,,
wav48/p312/p312_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|80,,
wav48/p312/p312_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbows have been formed.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increase as the size of the drops increases.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|80,,
wav48/p312/p312_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|80,,
wav48/p312/p312_025.wav|Perhaps that was their mistake.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_026.wav|This was a rationing decision.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_027.wav|The way forward is working with other disciplines.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_028.wav|He is doing the right things.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_029.wav|Blood samples were taken.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_030.wav|I've got the poster.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_031.wav|This is excellent news for the workforce.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_032.wav|We have a high quality product.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_033.wav|Haven't been so lucky since.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_034.wav|Well, you might have a point.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_035.wav|It was quite distressing for the crew.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_036.wav|Now the show is for public consumption.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_037.wav|That decision is now being appealed.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_038.wav|This is really good news for us.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_039.wav|I wish it wasn't so, but it is.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_040.wav|Not so, it transpires.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_041.wav|I shouldn't have put up with it.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_042.wav|I think so - he seems to be in good health.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_043.wav|I think it must be the uniforms.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_044.wav|This is not a monument to the past.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_045.wav|I certainly hope not.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_046.wav|However, there could be more bad weather to come.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_047.wav|I feel pretty good.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_048.wav|The group will report back in the summer.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_049.wav|Back then it was hard to refuse.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_050.wav|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_051.wav|I was in the zone in the morning.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_052.wav|We have to break that cycle.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_053.wav|In fact, it might just be the beginning.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_054.wav|The children are being very brave.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_055.wav|They have a car and cannot afford another.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_056.wav|My only concern is for my children.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_057.wav|This is welcome news.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_058.wav|The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_059.wav|The trust has no magic wand.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_060.wav|We just wish they had done so before.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_061.wav|It was a virus.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_062.wav|The rest, of course, is history.|80,,
wav48/p312/p312_063.wav|They chose the latter.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_064.wav|I've not said anything to them, they know.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_065.wav|All were later allowed home.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_066.wav|Will you just put it away?|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_067.wav|I think it's more important to have fun.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_068.wav|Who did the recruiting?|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_069.wav|It is still with Ministers.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_070.wav|The effect was almost magical.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_071.wav|It happened again, and again, and again.|80,,
wav48/p312/p312_072.wav|It showed him the way to drive.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_073.wav|I am still waiting for a reply.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_074.wav|After this, they were always in the driving seat.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_075.wav|Were they under-age?|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_076.wav|He was charged with perjury.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_077.wav|I started it, but then forgot all about it.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_078.wav|However, there would be no permanent displays.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_079.wav|The goal will come.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_080.wav|He could hardly have been in greater demand.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_081.wav|We didn't take our chances.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_082.wav|It was all very proper and civilised.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_083.wav|I've played them all in the Champions League.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_084.wav|There are many children.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_085.wav|That never seemed likely.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_086.wav|Action must be taken urgently.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_087.wav|I was brought up in a mining background.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_088.wav|Either system could have prevented the crash.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_089.wav|Here, the fans have been fantastic.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_090.wav|I thought his speech was a disgrace.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_091.wav|But these things are happening now.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_092.wav|I am very encouraged by this poll.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_093.wav|They should be swept away.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_094.wav|They thought the set-up there was unfair.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_095.wav|It will be a challenging film.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_096.wav|The test case is still awaiting action.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_097.wav|What happens next?|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_098.wav|He added, The old system has reached its limits.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_099.wav|We could easily be cut again.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_100.wav|The plot is minimal.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_101.wav|The scheme is hopelessly failing.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_102.wav|They're just a nonsense.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_103.wav|There may be some resistance.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_104.wav|I could not believe it.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_105.wav|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_106.wav|The Rangers think they have problems.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_107.wav|He will go a long way.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_108.wav|Then there was her childhood.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_109.wav|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_110.wav|I thought that all musicians were the same.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_111.wav|It's so much more fun.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_112.wav|I believe he could have turned it around.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_113.wav|Secondly, there are other options for patients.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_114.wav|Where do you think she is going?|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_115.wav|This looks like it's anything but open.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_116.wav|I am not against a further inquiry.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_117.wav|Such is the scene of the tragedy.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_118.wav|It's a double whammy.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_119.wav|What's the theme?|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_120.wav|We are satisfied that this is the case.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_121.wav|For me, it was a shattering experience.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_122.wav|This latter suggestion is very important.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_123.wav|The deadline for selecting the electors is today.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_124.wav|Davis is very supportive, as a director.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_125.wav|There was some merit in that.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_126.wav|That is a trend which will be encouraged.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_127.wav|What's wrong with that?|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_128.wav|The pain is still acute.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_129.wav|His remit is specific.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_130.wav|It is a very big problem.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_131.wav|Frustration is not the word.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_132.wav|The police have to act to help them.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_133.wav|She was extremely rigid.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_134.wav|It may be down, but New York is not out.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_135.wav|But what lies ahead?|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_136.wav|I am so upset.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_137.wav|I was blown out of proportion.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_138.wav|There was a definite prejudice.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_139.wav|It's the same with us.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_140.wav|It's an awful lot of money.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_141.wav|He was the architect.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_142.wav|This should include procedures for personal imports.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_143.wav|It's a fantastic achievement.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_144.wav|Neither was in the squad announced yesterday.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_145.wav|He, too, was not satisfied.|80,,
wav48/p312/p312_146.wav|It's easy to see why.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_147.wav|I've never regretted coming here.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_148.wav|He is in a lot of pain, it's very distressing.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_149.wav|I am so, so, so lucky.|80,,
wav48/p312/p312_150.wav|We still have a long, long way to go.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_151.wav|I fell into it by accident.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_152.wav|I only wanted to give her a fright.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_153.wav|Where does it come from?|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_154.wav|Norman was not doing so bad, either.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_155.wav|If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_156.wav|It is almost certain to be the last.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_157.wav|Britain hasn't seen it in this way.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_158.wav|That says something for his strength of character.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_159.wav|The world is being invited to visit.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_160.wav|If it's not, they didn't go far enough.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_161.wav|I think it's a sensible change.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_162.wav|Sex is fun?|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_163.wav|I'm not sure.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_164.wav|His first album was a hit.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_165.wav|He had played well in that central role.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_166.wav|And who would argue with that?|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_167.wav|It was visibly on fire.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_168.wav|What's it for, after all?|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_169.wav|Who would be out there, singing?|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_170.wav|A number of people could not speak English.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_171.wav|They have got off with murder.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_172.wav|Charges against the pair were found not proven.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_173.wav|This remains the party's policy.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_174.wav|I cannot say anymore.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_175.wav|They want this research to continue.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_176.wav|Robert is a special talent.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_177.wav|They are going to carry it through.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_178.wav|It was very, very dejected.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_179.wav|You can't keep them separate.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_180.wav|I think it can count against you now.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_181.wav|He was a legend.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_182.wav|That's when the story first appeared.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_183.wav|You're going to die.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_184.wav|There was a substantial explosion.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_185.wav|He will continue to provide support for them.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_186.wav|I'm going to see my friend.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_187.wav|We played too deeply.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_188.wav|I probably would have been a dancer.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_189.wav|There is a lot of heroin about.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_190.wav|We're going to see a Government in a hurry.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_191.wav|He never asked me for money.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_192.wav|I was a bit nervous.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_193.wav|There was no question of him not impressing.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_194.wav|However, we came through.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_195.wav|I love this tournament.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_196.wav|He had a heart problem.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_197.wav|I am desperate to play for Scotland.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_198.wav|It is a large number.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_199.wav|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_200.wav|Hear what they have to say.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_201.wav|Now there's a thought.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_202.wav|I believe that the answer is simple.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_203.wav|That, he claimed, was essential.|80,,
wav48/p312/p312_204.wav|I was on the pitch and everything.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_205.wav|They told him to go to drama school.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_206.wav|Clearly the impact is going to be negative.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_207.wav|Let us hope so.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_208.wav|She looked very settled.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_209.wav|Of course he was right!|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_210.wav|The next few months will tell.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_211.wav|It felt like my support system was leaving.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_212.wav|But my daughter has got nothing.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_213.wav|You can see their point.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_214.wav|Nobody, if he has anything to do with it.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_215.wav|The dangers are very obvious.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_216.wav|There were no casualties.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_217.wav|Is it in the right place?|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_218.wav|I played well in my time there.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_219.wav|A teacher is, really, about unity.|80,,
wav48/p312/p312_220.wav|They are still going to be impulsive.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_221.wav|I love you so very much.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_222.wav|The scheme was simple but extremely effective.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_223.wav|He is a very nice man.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_224.wav|We want to sort it out.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_225.wav|Sean Connery did not disappoint.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_226.wav|Such a city does not exist.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_227.wav|It made me determined to get back.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_228.wav|It was no avail.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_229.wav|We're going to see more extreme weather.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_230.wav|He was replaced by John Spencer.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_231.wav|Of course, we have to be very concerned about that.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_232.wav|That is in the very nature of farming.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_233.wav|And, also, when he does not have the ball.|80,,
wav48/p312/p312_234.wav|It was worth the wait.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_235.wav|I love the tradition of vaudeville.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_236.wav|It will take place in July.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_237.wav|We must not give in to the bastards.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_238.wav|This is a major step forward for carers.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_239.wav|I think it was his parents.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_240.wav|Our commitment is to move forward.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_241.wav|Partly, it is his own fault.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_242.wav|It's a personal matter.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_243.wav|That's where it all started.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_244.wav|I won't go back.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_245.wav|Why has it taken so long?|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_246.wav|You make the choice.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_247.wav|And does it?|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_248.wav|I was proud of our lads.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_249.wav|These will finally be corrected by next week.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_250.wav|This kind of traffic is commonplace.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_251.wav|All would be under threat.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_252.wav|Was it a foul?|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_253.wav|He leaves a beat.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_254.wav|Perhaps it was her demeanour.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_255.wav|It lasted longer than we thought.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_256.wav|Promises were not kept.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_257.wav|It hasn't happened, but other things have.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_258.wav|The claim was denied by first minister.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_259.wav|Who is he?|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_260.wav|It has to be long-term commitment.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_261.wav|It was that bad, that low.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_262.wav|That would be a big mistake.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_263.wav|His arrival could be the making of them.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_264.wav|After all, this is the start of the giving age.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_265.wav|I said How much?|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_266.wav|You are a liar.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_267.wav|The scheme has been funded by the Government.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_268.wav|We're still talking about it.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_269.wav|She would say he was still the best.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_270.wav|He finished the night in a cell.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_271.wav|I'm not afraid of that.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_272.wav|I don't know what he was shouting.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_273.wav|It is the icing on the cake.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_274.wav|It was a new ball game.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_275.wav|The people here are quite reserved.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_276.wav|Previously police had said that schools were safe.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_277.wav|Our legal advice is clear.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_278.wav|The past is history, not destiny.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_279.wav|These were the edited highlights.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_280.wav|All were within range of Israeli cities.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_281.wav|They were totally behind it.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_282.wav|However, it is believed they were from the Highlands.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_283.wav|We could do a lot worse.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_284.wav|Knowledge is everything at this level.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_285.wav|Inquiries are ongoing into this incident.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_286.wav|It is all one-sided.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_287.wav|In the end, that was enough to beat England.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_288.wav|That was the initial attraction.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_289.wav|Who will take them after that?|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_290.wav|He's also thinking long-term.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_291.wav|A kinder but effective treatment would be welcomed.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_292.wav|Trevor has been great.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_293.wav|It would also take time.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_294.wav|Rather than answer, she resigned.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_295.wav|She said No, he's not in Elgin today.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_296.wav|I was first in the door.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_297.wav|It is highly unlikely.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_298.wav|Bill is a mentor.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_299.wav|The atmosphere is businesslike.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_300.wav|I have fallen in love with the Highlands.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_301.wav|There will be no exceptions to this rule.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_302.wav|What makes a house a home?|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_303.wav|Destruction came from within.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_304.wav|I think however, he was having a fit!|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_305.wav|It is good to look back.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_306.wav|You can't do one without the other.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_307.wav|Obviously we want to stop the rot.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_308.wav|Chris Paterson was outstanding.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_309.wav|The casting of her husband was an accident.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_310.wav|I would say so.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_311.wav|It's not the end of the matter, of course.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_312.wav|Sub Not Used, McKay.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_313.wav|And they did just that.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_314.wav|You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_315.wav|She has left the island.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_316.wav|They had three children.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_317.wav|Our system is archaic.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_318.wav|She had kept the news from him.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_319.wav|We want to know about the policy.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_320.wav|It is not illegal.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_321.wav|I wouldn't say this is normal.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_322.wav|We don't have the credible evidence.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_323.wav|That will be the case on Tuesday.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_324.wav|It's one up to the Scots.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_325.wav|This is complete nonsense.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_326.wav|I don't want to use the term.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_327.wav|There is still hope.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_328.wav|It has the Bank of Scotland behind it.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_329.wav|It's all happening at a local level.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_330.wav|She is a great talent.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_331.wav|It's the big omission.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_332.wav|We do things in an appropriate way.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_334.wav|However, she is female, and so.|80,,
wav48/p312/p312_335.wav|The playing is perfectly turned out.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_336.wav|He will be advised by me.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_337.wav|But he did not rule out further talks.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_338.wav|It's part of your life.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_339.wav|He had a horror.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_340.wav|We're delighted and we certainly deserved it.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_341.wav|This time we may not be seeking volunteers.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_342.wav|That was the biggest game of my life.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_343.wav|This is perfectly legal.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_344.wav|That's the most important thing for me.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_345.wav|Then came the second round.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_346.wav|Quite simply, no-one else is willing to do so.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_347.wav|Saddam is not threatening this country.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_348.wav|We told them in June.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_349.wav|Parents should avoid it.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_350.wav|It was not a difficult decision, he said.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_351.wav|It was a horrible thing to happen.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_352.wav|And she's not even in the book!|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_353.wav|Of course it's a bunch of trouble.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_354.wav|I feel really sorry for the Iraqi people.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_355.wav|He, too, is killing.|80,,
wav48/p312/p312_356.wav|Bin Laden is believed to be left-handed.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_357.wav|It's better to be happy.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_358.wav|It's just so sad.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_359.wav|We have lost the round, but not the fight.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_360.wav|And Scotland is no different.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_361.wav|It's been an extremely frustrating year for me.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_362.wav|We are in a learning curve.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_363.wav|He can do everything.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_364.wav|She was just that sort of person.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_365.wav|Is it a warning to parents?|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_366.wav|You've gotten all the facts.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_367.wav|And it will be even more difficult tomorrow.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_368.wav|Soon the whole country will be level.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_369.wav|And huge, indeed, it is.|80,,
wav48/p312/p312_370.wav|I'm not interested in coming up with answers.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_371.wav|Attack appears to be the biggest concern.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_372.wav|For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_373.wav|He said he needed no more evidence.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_374.wav|It's such a tragedy.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_375.wav|It was a long time coming.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_376.wav|Gordon Brown was superb.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_377.wav|The referee didn't do his job.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_378.wav|We are very nearly there.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_379.wav|Stand by for action.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_380.wav|Barry will be able to handle this.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_381.wav|However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_382.wav|The urgency is real.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_383.wav|They have been for some time now.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_384.wav|It was only logical to end it.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_385.wav|Yet the consensus is, it's worth it.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_386.wav|I've no passion for any country.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_387.wav|Scotland needs to hear it, too.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_388.wav|Nobody ever gets to see them.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_389.wav|That's an old idea.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_390.wav|It is part and parcel of it.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_391.wav|The only safe investment is cash.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_392.wav|It's the whole season.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_393.wav|We had no choice but to go down.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_394.wav|We are keen to have him back.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_395.wav|This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_396.wav|Of course, it was very passionate in Glasgow.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_397.wav|And we all understand that.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_398.wav|The new incitement offence will cover all religions.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_399.wav|Clearly, the future remains uncertain.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_400.wav|Do what you have to do.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_401.wav|We must do well in that.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_402.wav|She died later on Monday.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_403.wav|No-one has yet been charged.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_404.wav|If so, they were wrong.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_405.wav|This is my big break.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_406.wav|It was meant to rival the dollar.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_407.wav|There is no easy answer.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_408.wav|There was someone on the floor.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_409.wav|I put pressure on him.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_410.wav|He supported the decision to review the decision.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_411.wav|It was chaotic and frightening.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_412.wav|Friday night was a pretty good night.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_413.wav|He will never walk the streets again.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_414.wav|The proposals have been taken out of context.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_415.wav|Golf has lost a great character.|80,,,,
wav48/p312/p312_416.wav|However, it has had only a limited uptake.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_417.wav|I have to say, for me, the game was not.|80,,
wav48/p312/p312_418.wav|However, the report was incorrect.|80,,,
wav48/p312/p312_419.wav|There was no pressure at all.|80,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_001.wav|Please call Stella.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|81,,
wav48/p313/p313_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|81,,
wav48/p313/p313_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|81,,
wav48/p313/p313_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_018.wav|Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the sizes of the drops increases.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|81,,
wav48/p313/p313_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|81,,
wav48/p313/p313_025.wav|They will be dealt with.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_026.wav|It is never an easy game.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_027.wav|This year it will be Billy Crystal.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_028.wav|I intend to raise the matter there.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_029.wav|However, it's good to turn the page.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_030.wav|We have to put this behind us.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_031.wav|I thought it was quite good.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_032.wav|It was important to win the singles.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_033.wav|This is a disaster averted for Scotland.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_034.wav|That is impressive by any standards.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_035.wav|We are doing very well as we are.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_036.wav|The waiting is over, well almost.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_037.wav|This was the performance, and the result they needed.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_038.wav|I'm not allowed to say that, of course.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_039.wav|It helped me to get noticed.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_040.wav|They hit me in the head.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_041.wav|But he is not using them.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_042.wav|That, though, was just the start of it.|81,,
wav48/p313/p313_043.wav|We are not moving in.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_044.wav|We have not had a formal request.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_045.wav|I never had a childhood.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_046.wav|Its effect on humans is not yet known.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_047.wav|We offered something different.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_048.wav|We were very much a happy family.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_049.wav|He was critically ill in hospital last night.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_050.wav|My brother's buried under there.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_051.wav|Their conditions are described as serious but stable.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_052.wav|What were they?|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_053.wav|It was large enough to fit the wall.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_054.wav|He will be judged by his actions.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_055.wav|Her role in it was small.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_056.wav|I've really noticed that this week.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_057.wav|We might be back next year.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_058.wav|In a way he was.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_059.wav|It's back to how it used to be.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_060.wav|It is not a standing army.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_061.wav|The firm was down and almost out.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_062.wav|They said they were only young men.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_063.wav|I was chosen to do this.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_064.wav|I learned a lot from that.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_065.wav|The house was so well alight.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_066.wav|He got his degree.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_067.wav|Sandy was very active.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_068.wav|However, there is great potential in this right.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_069.wav|We have no idea what caused the derailment.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_070.wav|I'm confident of the outcome this week.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_071.wav|There were no formal announcements.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_072.wav|Before the games it was pretty open.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_073.wav|It really has left the town in shock.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_074.wav|But you can go beyond that condition.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_075.wav|I'm so worried about the roads.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_076.wav|This was much worse.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_077.wav|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_078.wav|We are confident of taking that back.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_079.wav|They must be kept on the ground.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_080.wav|Did they give any good advice?|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_081.wav|Who wants to be a millionaire?|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_082.wav|This does not help.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_083.wav|I've invented a village in East Lothian.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_084.wav|That's why the ministers resigned.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_085.wav|He has lost confidence and weight.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_086.wav|This process of attrition is expected to continue.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_087.wav|Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_088.wav|This could be her way forward.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_089.wav|This gives us a lot of practice.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_090.wav|The Parliament will make its own decisions.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_091.wav|It's a very, very special day.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_092.wav|The crucial strike was yet to come.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_093.wav|There's also the point.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_094.wav|It was forced to divert.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_095.wav|Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_096.wav|That's the National Grid.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_097.wav|But Allen is deadly serious.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_098.wav|Peter doesn't want to leave.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_099.wav|He wouldn't allow that to happen.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_100.wav|They've just got to believe in themselves.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_101.wav|This is my personal assessment.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_102.wav|There was no trouble at all.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_103.wav|Although, you never know.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_104.wav|We shall be victorious.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_105.wav|The quality of work is very impressive.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_106.wav|However, he added there were signs of progress.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_107.wav|Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.|81,,
wav48/p313/p313_108.wav|I think the Scottish bid is very strong.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_109.wav|Nothing is being offered in exchange.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_110.wav|I took the gun.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_111.wav|It's just one of those things.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_112.wav|A web site is planned for November.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_113.wav|We played so well at times.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_114.wav|I was very fortunate.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_115.wav|Such a policy would be a disaster.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_116.wav|We act because we must.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_117.wav|They will be destroyed.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_118.wav|We didn't get the supply to the forwards.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_119.wav|O Neill is reputed to have replied.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_120.wav|The Tory party will last.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_121.wav|It was a journey into a new life.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_122.wav|It's a way of making a mark.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_123.wav|There is a great carry over value.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_124.wav|Life, as many people know it, in other words.|81,,
wav48/p313/p313_125.wav|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_126.wav|What's the point?|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_127.wav|Why is this?|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_128.wav|What has changed since then?|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_129.wav|Raymond was always on the outside.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_130.wav|We need to make more inquiries about that.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_131.wav|I'd love to be at the World Cup.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_132.wav|He is expected to be interviewed by detectives.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_133.wav|I'm sorry to hear this news.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_134.wav|At some point, the bill will be presented.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_135.wav|I mean it happens.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_136.wav|This week is a perfect example.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_137.wav|This performance has given my confidence a boost.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_138.wav|Receiving this medal is an honour.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_139.wav|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_140.wav|But every two minutes it was exploding.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_141.wav|That sort of thing is long gone.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_142.wav|It's typical of me.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_143.wav|However, consumers may take a different view.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_144.wav|They played it like a cup final.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_145.wav|However, it's not all bad news for women.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_146.wav|But the championship is not over yet.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_147.wav|We haven't found out anything different.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_148.wav|A review of the decision is being sought.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_149.wav|It will be about commitment, not compliance.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_150.wav|Still, in the end, it was a fair result.|81,,
wav48/p313/p313_151.wav|Surely it can do better than that?|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_152.wav|I am ashamed of them.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_153.wav|Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.|81,,
wav48/p313/p313_154.wav|The salary changes are long overdue.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_155.wav|I, like an idiot, agreed.|81,,
wav48/p313/p313_156.wav|If so, we want to hear from them.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_157.wav|I'm not blaming audiences.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_158.wav|Who was on the panel?|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_159.wav|They may differ on other issues.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_160.wav|He'd never run the distance before.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_161.wav|I can make one further announcement.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_162.wav|The General Election is all to play for.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_163.wav|It was a fiery game.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_164.wav|Agents and coaches must be paid.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_165.wav|Golf is a game of honour and ethics.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_166.wav|Obviously, a lot has changed for me since then.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_167.wav|It will not be easy for him.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_168.wav|This one is a special case.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_169.wav|But what are the songs about?|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_170.wav|There is a simmering anger out there.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_171.wav|The ministers are now to make their decision.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_172.wav|That is not a position they enjoy.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_173.wav|The stadium was full.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_174.wav|Dewar is the medium.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_175.wav|It was that kind of night.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_176.wav|It is very much a matter for them.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_177.wav|Perhaps it is jealousy.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_178.wav|Any error is severely punished.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_179.wav|He's got a great chance of making it.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_180.wav|We won't do that.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_181.wav|I hope we do.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_182.wav|From now on there is no hiding place.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_183.wav|I didn't want to ignore the punters.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_184.wav|He quit in October.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_185.wav|The United Nations must act.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_186.wav|Sponsors include the Sunday Herald.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_187.wav|Her daughter is getting married.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_188.wav|His manager blamed the referee.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_189.wav|They were that poor.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_190.wav|Patients will be partners in decision making.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_191.wav|We have understood the problems for some time.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_192.wav|Stan is a vital part of our future.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_193.wav|All these things have an impact.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_194.wav|That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_195.wav|They believed it worked.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_196.wav|After that, though, we're still waiting to see.|81,,
wav48/p313/p313_197.wav|They should feel ashamed.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_198.wav|This is a really serious issue.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_199.wav|So they will settle again.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_200.wav|How do we get more people in?|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_201.wav|I'm just looking to take my chances.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_202.wav|It looks as though there is no chance.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_203.wav|This is not a European Army.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_204.wav|Election results are expected soon.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_205.wav|So she told him.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_206.wav|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_207.wav|There are moments of honesty, too.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_208.wav|It was good to score the goal today.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_209.wav|The night is young.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_210.wav|Sadly, too, many of them are similar.|81,,
wav48/p313/p313_211.wav|I suspect that it will.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_212.wav|But there's no eye contact.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_213.wav|The squad will be the same for France.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_214.wav|We are a party for people, not against people.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_215.wav|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_216.wav|We're still paying the price for that.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_217.wav|He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_218.wav|It's not a wish list.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_219.wav|He's very, very lucky to be alive.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_220.wav|Some of the players have not progressed.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_221.wav|It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_222.wav|If not, he should go home.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_223.wav|We remain committed to it, as does the government.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_224.wav|There is no margin for error.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_225.wav|This was not an easy meeting for me.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_226.wav|From our point of view, it's the right time.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_227.wav|That figure will always remain with me.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_228.wav|And then a funny thing happened.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_229.wav|It doesn't take much.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_230.wav|She asked us a lot of questions.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_231.wav|It was a stunning strike.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_232.wav|It is a technique.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_233.wav|They hold on for many years.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_234.wav|Is it the shape of things to come?|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_235.wav|My body is exhausted.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_236.wav|Home is in the Scottish Borders.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_237.wav|We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_238.wav|There is nothing to fear.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_239.wav|I was an athlete.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_240.wav|Life was like a timetable.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_241.wav|World leaders expressed their sympathy.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_242.wav|I tried to push him away.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_243.wav|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_244.wav|This was done by the council staff.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_245.wav|The truth is otherwise.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_246.wav|We haven't come out of this very well.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_247.wav|I wanted to put myself on the line.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_248.wav|I thought they could have made the gesture.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_249.wav|We should be rewarded for producing.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_250.wav|The bottom line is that this must stop.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_251.wav|Which, in effect, it is.|81,,
wav48/p313/p313_252.wav|The man became a reporter.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_253.wav|It is a memorial.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_254.wav|We feel it sends out the wrong message.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_255.wav|Our people are paying high prices.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_256.wav|The reason is partly because of tradition.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_257.wav|Nor is it likely to do so.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_258.wav|Or so everyone believed.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_259.wav|Perhaps we should do the same.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_260.wav|I read it every year.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_261.wav|He was in contention almost every week.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_262.wav|Every school in Scotland should be excellent.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_263.wav|It's up to Ann.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_264.wav|We are playing them at their own game.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_265.wav|By this point the couple were approaching fast.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_266.wav|I had trouble with the producers.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_267.wav|So, it took me back to boarding school.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_268.wav|They just thought it was extremely good acting.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_269.wav|The conference is the first test.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_270.wav|That's what we're trying to achieve.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_271.wav|I expect a rapid response.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_272.wav|There was still more disquiet in Israel.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_273.wav|There is no more money.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_274.wav|My mother is a widow.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_275.wav|The rubble was right up to the ceiling.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_276.wav|There have been different reports from different people.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_277.wav|It's an absolute disgrace.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_278.wav|Something was plainly wrong.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_279.wav|Why should he go anywhere?|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_280.wav|One thing is sure.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_281.wav|It was a foolhardy decision.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_282.wav|I'm confident we can do that.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_283.wav|Funding needs to be long term.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_284.wav|It's funny how it comes and goes.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_285.wav|I would never even consider it.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_286.wav|We're talking about the outskirts of London.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_287.wav|The end result is precisely the same.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_288.wav|We have it on video.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_289.wav|I'm not a threat to coaches.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_290.wav|Painful, but only because it's true.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_291.wav|It's never over until it's over.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_292.wav|Colonel, About this committee that is coming.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_293.wav|This year, it was a little different.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_294.wav|That, though, is to miss the point.|81,,
wav48/p313/p313_295.wav|We gave them the goal.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_296.wav|Is being naturally funny enough?|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_297.wav|What's the point of staying sober?|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_298.wav|We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_299.wav|The incident is being taken seriously.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_300.wav|So what's the shape, and what's the detail?|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_301.wav|They were going through the motions, but that's about all.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_302.wav|I can feel the sound inside.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_303.wav|I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_304.wav|I'm not a fan of books.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_305.wav|SO now we know the secret.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_306.wav|It may well have been.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_307.wav|I never had any confidence in it afterwards.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_308.wav|It was a simple question.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_309.wav|I find this ongoing debate is demeaning.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_310.wav|And we've beaten them before.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_311.wav|Could you put it in writing?|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_312.wav|I'm not a paedophile.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_313.wav|Some of their movement was excellent.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_314.wav|But they had to be paid for.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_315.wav|The odds are that it will.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_316.wav|But then they scored their fourth.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_317.wav|They deserve a lot of credit.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_318.wav|That's the position that the MoD has adopted.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_319.wav|Why is that?|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_320.wav|Then came the crunch.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_321.wav|But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_322.wav|But will they fall in love?|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_323.wav|As if they ever stopped.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_324.wav|The referee had a shocking game.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_325.wav|Players are fighting to stay in the team.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_326.wav|For a few years we had good fun.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_327.wav|Medical staff are with them at the moment.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_328.wav|It went on to become an annual event.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_329.wav|This is the logic of punishment assaults.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_330.wav|We are now in an election period.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_331.wav|Everyone's too upset to comment.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_332.wav|Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_333.wav|But when we do it is great.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_334.wav|She has nothing to say to journalists.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_335.wav|I didn't want to fall out with anyone.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_336.wav|He pleaded for caution.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_339.wav|I can't believe the buzz.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_340.wav|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_341.wav|The picture is the same across Scotland.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_342.wav|When it comes down to it, this is a job.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_343.wav|It's no less intriguing, however.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_344.wav|It's a question of perception.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_345.wav|Staff have been informed.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_346.wav|My heart is not so sure.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_347.wav|This morning was very quiet.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_348.wav|On reflection, it was really quite exciting.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_349.wav|It's been handled entirely properly.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_350.wav|I shall be voting Yes to support him.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_351.wav|That might help a bit.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_352.wav|Two others were also seriously injured.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_353.wav|He was made redundant in February of last year.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_354.wav|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_355.wav|Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_356.wav|You've obviously got an answer to it.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_357.wav|It seems very odd.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_358.wav|Closure is not one of them.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_359.wav|The hotel was huge.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_360.wav|A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_361.wav|Well, you can have a tree.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_362.wav|It was the same at Twickenham.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_363.wav|This is an internal matter.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_364.wav|I'm amazed at what he's done.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_365.wav|They took a risk.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_366.wav|The idea was presented to me.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_367.wav|The hearing in Edinburgh continues.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_368.wav|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_369.wav|His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_370.wav|The hearing was fair.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_371.wav|I see it as my job.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_372.wav|This was not a summit about the euro.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_373.wav|Frank Warren is a great man.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_374.wav|I'm a little bit tired.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_375.wav|That was never their agenda.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_376.wav|She died at her home.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_377.wav|She's currently in foster care.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_378.wav|That's the only thing that matters.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_379.wav|I enjoy the creative process.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_380.wav|They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_381.wav|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.|81,,
wav48/p313/p313_382.wav|As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_383.wav|It's always the same, isn't it?|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_384.wav|We have been preparing all year.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_385.wav|We could learn a lot from them.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_386.wav|I can't wait for the outdoors.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_387.wav|Sure, we have problems.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_388.wav|I was released after six days.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_389.wav|That time is not far away.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_390.wav|I may think about performing it.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_391.wav|There are a number of possible outcomes.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_392.wav|We also enjoyed a lot of support.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_393.wav|This is the last thing we ever expected.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_394.wav|You can't go back and change things.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_395.wav|It's time to fight a decisive battle.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_396.wav|Of course, it is a tough assignment.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_397.wav|Instead, it's back to the drawing board.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_398.wav|He says it often enough.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_399.wav|Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_400.wav|His primary residence is Scotland.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_401.wav|I found that much more challenging.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_402.wav|This fight is not going to go away.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_403.wav|It would have been very easily done.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_404.wav|I will never manage another Scottish club.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_405.wav|The Open champion is back.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_406.wav|It's going to be a new challenge.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_407.wav|As, indeed, they would be.|81,,
wav48/p313/p313_408.wav|I want to keep him.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_409.wav|He deserves a top team.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_410.wav|I knew people on that committee.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_411.wav|The next eight weeks are critical to us.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_412.wav|Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_413.wav|Her grand-daughter was uninjured.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_414.wav|We never agreed to it.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_415.wav|But that night they killed her housekeeper.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_416.wav|But it's not the end of Scottish football.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_417.wav|Sightings were replaced by rumours.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_418.wav|Would they work together again?|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_419.wav|I didn't play all that well.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_420.wav|Who can tell?|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_421.wav|It appears to have been closed down.|81,,,,
wav48/p313/p313_422.wav|Now, that is a good deal.|81,,,
wav48/p313/p313_423.wav|The whole nation will be delighted.|81,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_001.wav|Please call Stella.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|82,,
wav48/p314/p314_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|82,,
wav48/p314/p314_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|82,,
wav48/p314/p314_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|82,,
wav48/p314/p314_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|82,,
wav48/p314/p314_025.wav|The Scots are, however, in good company.|82,,
wav48/p314/p314_026.wav|He was born in London of Scottish parents.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_027.wav|Her condition last night was described as critical.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_028.wav|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_029.wav|Four other charges were dropped.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_030.wav|I believe in the Church.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_031.wav|We are just being flooded.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_032.wav|It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_033.wav|They tend to be easily influenced by others.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_034.wav|It's about bringing people in, breaking down barriers.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_035.wav|Well, what do you know?|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_036.wav|But she was very human.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_037.wav|There are some serious ethical issues involved.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_038.wav|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_039.wav|His concern is only for the future.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_040.wav|We have reacted well to each other.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_041.wav|Pupils and staff were sent home early.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_042.wav|It is all about people being assaulted, abused.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_043.wav|I'm delighted with how he has come through.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_044.wav|In fact, he didn't deliver a speech at the awards.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_045.wav|He will emerge as a world leader.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_046.wav|That view has not altered.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_047.wav|I only half believe it.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_048.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_049.wav|All the oil companies are talking together.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_050.wav|We have no choice but to shut down.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_051.wav|I'm feeling pretty good.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_052.wav|The prognosis is excellent.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_053.wav|Rangers deserved to beat us.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_054.wav|That, though, is the measure of the man.|82,,
wav48/p314/p314_055.wav|It was developed in the Gulf War.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_056.wav|Sub Not Used, MacKay.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_057.wav|It is not normal practice.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_058.wav|But he just carried on anyway.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_059.wav|The spirit in the squad is certainly good.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_060.wav|What happens next?|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_061.wav|I would not want to be young again.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_062.wav|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_063.wav|I'm astonished the men were not injured.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_064.wav|There are schoolboys in uniform.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_065.wav|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.|82
wav48/p314/p314_066.wav|They were later discharged from hospital.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_067.wav|Let's see that increase over the years.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_068.wav|I've learned a lot, and tomorrow is another day.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_069.wav|They knew they shouldn't have been there.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_070.wav|These findings would be made public.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_071.wav|It's the most beautiful place on earth.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_072.wav|I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.|82,,
wav48/p314/p314_073.wav|You can't go on forever.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_074.wav|All the lads are totally focused on that.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_075.wav|So far this season this approach is working.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_076.wav|I have got a knife.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_077.wav|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_078.wav|What did we learn?|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_079.wav|I go home only once.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_080.wav|I'm not going to answer that right now.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_081.wav|It had a gigantic effect.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_082.wav|On that basis, he would set it aside.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_083.wav|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.|82,,
wav48/p314/p314_084.wav|Bin Laden was not mentioned.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_085.wav|Does it work, is it safe, and is it right?|82,,
wav48/p314/p314_086.wav|The team this year is going places.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_087.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_088.wav|We should do everything at a stroke.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_089.wav|He had a moustache.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_090.wav|He has changed my life for ever.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_091.wav|It plans to return to this field.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_092.wav|He said because people had invited him.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_093.wav|Action must be taken urgently.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_094.wav|They are completely different from each other.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_095.wav|The money is not really our concern.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_096.wav|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_097.wav|Correction, knowing him, he might.|82,,
wav48/p314/p314_098.wav|I came up through the ranks.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_099.wav|Why does she suddenly win everything now?|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_100.wav|His team management was protective.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_101.wav|He was the deputy editor at the paper.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_102.wav|The proposal was rejected.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_103.wav|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_104.wav|We wanted it left for a wee while.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_105.wav|That would be even more disastrous.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_106.wav|These guys will not lie down.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_107.wav|You can expect a hell of a fuss.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_108.wav|Harrowing is easy, after all.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_109.wav|That is nearly four people every day.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_110.wav|There are nine people here now.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_111.wav|Is my wife a racist?|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_112.wav|It is a pity, but you can't have everything.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_113.wav|This would not be my first choice.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_114.wav|His wife Margaret was not in court.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_115.wav|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.|82,,
wav48/p314/p314_116.wav|Which perhaps is just as well.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_117.wav|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_118.wav|He would just say it was terrible.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_119.wav|They have got their position, we have got our position.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_120.wav|That's not fair to the supporters.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_121.wav|I saw military vehicles in the distance.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_122.wav|But the killer remains at large.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_123.wav|It is a great shame.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_124.wav|There are a lot of examples.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_125.wav|But it will backfire.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_126.wav|But then he changed his mind.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_127.wav|I really hope he thinks that through.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_128.wav|Police were also perplexed.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_129.wav|For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_130.wav|It's very tragic and traumatic.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_131.wav|For me, it's a tension you can feel.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_132.wav|That's a huge amount.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_133.wav|The final stage is paranoia.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_134.wav|I'm not holding the club to ransom.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_135.wav|Her advice for Glasgow is just be visionary.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_136.wav|Folk music is in her blood.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_137.wav|Pig farmers are completely despondent.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_138.wav|They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_139.wav|We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_140.wav|I would love it.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_141.wav|This is the high point of my career.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_142.wav|That's the sort of game you want.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_143.wav|My duty is to win.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_144.wav|Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_145.wav|We are trying to clarify the issues.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_146.wav|Now we look forward to it.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_147.wav|There is no such thing.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_148.wav|We've had an enjoyable adventure.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_149.wav|He was telling me to keep quiet.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_150.wav|It was a moment of madness.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_151.wav|Don't even bother applying.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_152.wav|But perhaps we shouldn't worry too much.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_153.wav|We like being the underdogs.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_154.wav|We haven't seen from the Bank of Scotland.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_155.wav|But we are not immune to the problem.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_156.wav|Racism has no place in any sport.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_157.wav|It's all too short term.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_158.wav|It is believed she had serious head injuries.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_159.wav|We must move on.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_160.wav|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_161.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_162.wav|The pilot was making a visual approach.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_163.wav|I'd say we should give it a week.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_164.wav|The elections should have no role in this.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_165.wav|I should not be able to stand.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_166.wav|Many other Scottish locations also feature.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_167.wav|Little Voice is on general release.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_168.wav|Frankly, it was worth the booking.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_169.wav|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_170.wav|They've got to get better.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_171.wav|He realises he has hit a glass ceiling.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_172.wav|This is good news for the Western Isles.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_173.wav|We've got the top three.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_174.wav|I was never alone with her, right?|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_175.wav|There is no substitute.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_176.wav|That nation is South Africa.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_177.wav|This will secure the future of our industry.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_178.wav|It's just a normal life.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_179.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_180.wav|I cannot speak on behalf of the IRA.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_181.wav|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_182.wav|That's when you hope to take advantage.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_183.wav|He is the example for all of us.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_184.wav|There is no way to do this.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_185.wav|It was an empowering journey.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_186.wav|Clearly we were looking at this very carefully.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_187.wav|I certainly do not agree with that.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_188.wav|It was a disaster of a race.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_189.wav|It's not unlike the millennium bug.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_190.wav|No, it's never been mentioned.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_191.wav|They had been together for about three years.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_192.wav|O Neill has delivered.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_193.wav|That is a trend which will be encouraged.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_194.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_195.wav|Our customers come first.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_196.wav|We will reform the welfare state.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_197.wav|It may be his last for a while, too.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_198.wav|His director of football is leaving.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_199.wav|Mixing drugs and alcohol can be extremely dangerous.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_200.wav|The painting was started, but finishing it was quite another matter.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_201.wav|He is married, with one daughter, and lives in Kent.|82,,
wav48/p314/p314_202.wav|We don't want to be too intrusive.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_203.wav|We just want to get stuck in now.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_204.wav|Drugs are getting through.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_205.wav|Do you come from Moscow?|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_206.wav|He or she will oversee the leadership contest.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_207.wav|That night was a terrible muddle.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_208.wav|We are aware of the tribunal case.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_209.wav|You saw the football.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_210.wav|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_211.wav|He added, It is all about the search for power.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_212.wav|But he was a full, working member of our staff.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_213.wav|I am a little bit tired.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_214.wav|Broke the birdie record.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_215.wav|We have an attorney on the ground.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_216.wav|I looked forward to it.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_217.wav|That was a disgraceful performance.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_218.wav|I'd come back from London.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_219.wav|That it is a brand name.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_220.wav|She was an only child.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_221.wav|The text is reduced to bubbles.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_222.wav|They should come forward.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_223.wav|We don't say there was a massacre.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_224.wav|John Lennon is a very large industry.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_225.wav|The island will never recover.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_226.wav|That is not an easy thing.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_227.wav|Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_228.wav|Those who are unwilling or unable to improve.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_229.wav|Three weeks later, he resigned.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_230.wav|It is a court case.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_231.wav|She was a delightful person.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_232.wav|The next one comes up.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_233.wav|This fact is supported by audience research.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_234.wav|Of further privacy, he had no need.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_235.wav|Come to that, is any of this really happening?|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_236.wav|Both sides have to step back.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_237.wav|This is wonderful news.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_238.wav|Is he going to look after them?|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_239.wav|But if they were there, they were keeping a low profile.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_240.wav|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_241.wav|Obviously, we would want to look at this.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_242.wav|We are ready for the long haul.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_243.wav|I was just getting over the time difference.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_244.wav|I don't have any answer for them.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_245.wav|I look for dancers who are also actors.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_246.wav|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_247.wav|The death toll included five children.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_248.wav|EMI is a prime example.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_249.wav|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_250.wav|And what is she escaping from?|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_251.wav|You cannot allow it to go on.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_252.wav|A Scottish film studio is also being considered.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_253.wav|Not that Agassi was a believer.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_254.wav|A friendship that will endure.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_255.wav|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_256.wav|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_257.wav|That will not change.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_258.wav|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_259.wav|I thought that all musicians were the same.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_260.wav|I am deeply sorry they did.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_261.wav|Nowadays, it is workers united.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_262.wav|Asylum seekers are still being attacked and abused.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_263.wav|Who would have thought it?|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_264.wav|He is young but not too young.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_265.wav|I played well on Saturday and again today.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_266.wav|Lara is very, very much a girl.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_267.wav|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.|82,,
wav48/p314/p314_268.wav|I took a minibus into town.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_269.wav|They've been at it for five hours.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_270.wav|I'm not talking about his career.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_271.wav|I watched a game.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_272.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_273.wav|Blair is very positive at European Councils.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_274.wav|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.|82,,
wav48/p314/p314_275.wav|He has lost confidence and weight.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_276.wav|Intensive care has been very busy.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_277.wav|There was no let-up for the minnows.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_278.wav|Birthdays are wonderful and terrible things.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_279.wav|It could be a danger.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_280.wav|This is my home town.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_281.wav|His English counterpart agreed.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_282.wav|We will build upon the basic state pension.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_283.wav|Nothing can bring back their son.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_284.wav|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.|82,,
wav48/p314/p314_285.wav|It's part of the game, isn't it?|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_286.wav|Some may end up in hospital.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_287.wav|The first eviction takes place on Sunday.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_288.wav|The alliance said it may not wait.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_289.wav|I'm not putting myself down.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_290.wav|That is highly unfair.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_291.wav|There is great demand for human cloning.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_292.wav|I'm very tired, but it was worth it.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_293.wav|I am just trying to do my job.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_294.wav|I don't think we could have expected better.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_295.wav|You take a risk.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_296.wav|What are you going to do exactly?|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_297.wav|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_298.wav|Mr Mason is claiming unfair dismissal.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_299.wav|I just want to change my life.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_300.wav|A statement is expected in April.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_301.wav|Check that he is dead.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_302.wav|CELTIC Connections is here again - and the great debate.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_303.wav|He is also a great finisher.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_304.wav|This club have been fair to me.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_305.wav|He knew it would cost him millions.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_306.wav|This is too much like Scotland.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_307.wav|He's been here on numerous occasions.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_308.wav|A counter reaction was.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_309.wav|He said he was sorry.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_310.wav|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_311.wav|Clearly, she says, we would never resort to such devices.|82,,
wav48/p314/p314_312.wav|That only came out during a radio interview.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_313.wav|The record companies have gone through the floor.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_314.wav|We are waiting for them to calm down.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_315.wav|We are now setting about finding them.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_316.wav|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_317.wav|Neither was involved in violence.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_318.wav|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_319.wav|Lucky for us, he enjoyed the experience.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_320.wav|I am not among its admirers.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_321.wav|Hitches can be expected.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_322.wav|He wasn't ready to cope with the pressures.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_323.wav|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.|82,,
wav48/p314/p314_324.wav|I'll tell you honestly.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_325.wav|Dialogue is the key.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_326.wav|He will address the nation this evening.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_327.wav|They have shown a great desire and attitude.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_328.wav|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_329.wav|Motherwell have no such good fortune.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_330.wav|But he is revelling in the big stage.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_331.wav|You have to think not.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_332.wav|No, no, it's not what you think.|82,,
wav48/p314/p314_333.wav|This is a national crisis.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_334.wav|Scotland were beaten again.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_335.wav|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_336.wav|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_337.wav|The whole thing would be perfect.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_338.wav|What is the Working Families Tax Credit?|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_339.wav|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_340.wav|However, we had no failures on our side.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_341.wav|She had been sexually assaulted.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_342.wav|His job was not advertised.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_343.wav|The event has now gone to Helsinki.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_344.wav|It is a thing of beauty to watch.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_345.wav|With us, we just want them to respond.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_346.wav|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_347.wav|They are the heroes.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_348.wav|For me, it was a shattering experience.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_349.wav|Scottish life can be like this, too.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_350.wav|This seems like a very good idea.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_351.wav|It was not confirmed by Scotland Yard.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_352.wav|Their condition was described as stable yesterday.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_353.wav|It took more than two years.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_354.wav|There is access for disabled people.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_355.wav|The home was now under new management.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_356.wav|We don't want to push him.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_357.wav|I like what has happened!|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_358.wav|It is like a theatre of the absurd.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_359.wav|One was a lawyer.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_360.wav|There is no openness.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_361.wav|We are still going ahead with our plans.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_362.wav|It's being very carefully looked at.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_363.wav|It was a job he loved.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_364.wav|Now it has become a big picture.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_365.wav|It may encourage more people to prospect.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_366.wav|But let's not get carried away.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_367.wav|Filtering through this material a composite finally emerges.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_368.wav|This is the last thing we ever expected.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_369.wav|It looks like paradise.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_370.wav|This means a great deal to the families.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_371.wav|Alcohol and nicotine are now no-go areas.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_372.wav|We were short of athletes.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_373.wav|They want to avoid a flashpoint.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_374.wav|The European is a piece of vanity publishing.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_375.wav|We want to keep the pound.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_376.wav|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_377.wav|Only local people are helping.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_378.wav|They are so easy for youngsters to open.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_379.wav|There were three boys and two girls.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_380.wav|Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_381.wav|He had no answer.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_382.wav|There is a job to be done.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_383.wav|Scotland is too small a country for that.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_384.wav|I am not obsessed with sex.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_385.wav|Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_386.wav|I can't believe what has happened.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_387.wav|It's about my time as a guitarist.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_388.wav|You do that because you want to win.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_389.wav|At this level, you have all to perform well.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_390.wav|It was early morning.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_391.wav|Partition is not an option.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_392.wav|We've been treated with complete contempt.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_393.wav|There must be boundaries.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_394.wav|I cannot confirm the name of any driver.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_395.wav|The home team had an amazing start.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_396.wav|We can make changes.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_397.wav|It is a comforting fantasy - but it remains a fantasy.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_398.wav|The conclusion is enthralling.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_399.wav|Instead, it is back to the drawing board.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_400.wav|This is usually done by the space shuttle.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_401.wav|The best option is to destroy the plants.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_402.wav|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_403.wav|Friends of the family have given their support.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_404.wav|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.|82,,
wav48/p314/p314_405.wav|You name it, they have it.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_406.wav|We are obviously disturbed by this case.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_407.wav|The review has been conducted fairly.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_408.wav|There is no smoking gun.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_409.wav|We could play someone else, but he is ready to play.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_410.wav|He feels he has cost us the game, but he didn't.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_411.wav|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.|82,,
wav48/p314/p314_412.wav|It is a natural reaction.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_413.wav|Whether this return was too soon.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_414.wav|I don't believe that money is the answer.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_415.wav|Jackson may well be right.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_416.wav|I am in a very difficult position.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_417.wav|They will run in tandem with New Work.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_418.wav|As for Owen, class is permanent.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_419.wav|THE pain was almost too much to bear.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_420.wav|My thoughts are with their families.|82,,,,
wav48/p314/p314_421.wav|He is not very big, either.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_422.wav|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.|82,,,
wav48/p314/p314_423.wav|How come it is so often unnoticed?|82,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_001.wav|Please call Stella.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|84,,
wav48/p316/p316_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|84,,
wav48/p316/p316_009.wav|There is , according to a legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|84,,
wav48/p316/p316_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but the refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increase.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|84,,
wav48/p316/p316_025.wav|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_026.wav|Meetings will also remain private.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_027.wav|Have we tried everything?|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_028.wav|It's not going to work out that way.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_029.wav|We have worked hard.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_030.wav|After that, it's a step into the unknown.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_031.wav|Naturally, she said yes.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_032.wav|This is not a war on terror.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_033.wav|It is not for any other purpose.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_034.wav|There will always be problems on the way.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_035.wav|Why you did it will never be known.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_036.wav|He was in his element.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_037.wav|She is believed to be in South Africa.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_038.wav|What a week he has had.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_039.wav|We just want this season to end.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_040.wav|He is looking for a sporting challenge.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_041.wav|There is a new confidence about the club.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_042.wav|I accept that, but is very upsetting.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_043.wav|We accept the challenge.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_044.wav|The question is, Will it be enough?|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_045.wav|After that it is up to the boss.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_046.wav|They were taken to prove a point.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_047.wav|It doesn't have to be in Inverness.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_048.wav|And they removed a Borderer.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_049.wav|So, why does he do it?|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_050.wav|I would love to have him home.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_051.wav|It is very unfair, and something should be done.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_052.wav|He had no enemies.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_053.wav|That is not the case this time.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_054.wav|We are going to New Broomfield to win.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_055.wav|But the law is very clear on this.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_056.wav|They treated me with respect and courtesy.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_057.wav|There was only silence.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_058.wav|However, he said it would be likely to bring a chill.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_059.wav|It doesn't look as pretty.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_060.wav|However, our players will fight for that.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_061.wav|Everyone was very saddened.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_062.wav|He declined to give further details.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_063.wav|He said it was for sale.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_064.wav|This is a dream come true.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_065.wav|The problem is not confined to the UK.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_066.wav|I wouldn't give them a grade.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_067.wav|What on earth is wrong with you?|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_068.wav|This is far too high.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_069.wav|We are still going ahead with our plans.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_070.wav|IS Tony Blair on drugs?|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_071.wav|And if he hadn't become a musician?|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_072.wav|It has certainly paid off for him.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_073.wav|He was also a great man.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_074.wav|We have a major concern about the enforcement action.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_075.wav|It is clear that change is required.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_076.wav|Thirty schools were closed in the Western Isles.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_077.wav|This is a big step up.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_078.wav|Robin Williams is subdued.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_079.wav|The judge was very nice.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_080.wav|They control the prices paid to farmers.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_081.wav|The company yesterday refused to comment.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_082.wav|Most of them have already gone home.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_083.wav|Worse still, he might be singing Lady in Red.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_084.wav|Weaknesses there are, however.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_085.wav|It is, after all, a very funny play.|84,,
wav48/p316/p316_086.wav|Can you imagine a world without design?|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_087.wav|He was caught and fired.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_088.wav|I feel confident about the outcome.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_089.wav|The driver escaped injury.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_090.wav|Mini rugby is a great thing.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_091.wav|There was no bad behaviour.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_092.wav|Today she has been released.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_093.wav|It's a much bigger problem.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_094.wav|There are no problems between us at all.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_095.wav|Hopefully, he will be back in contention next week.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_096.wav|I've had it for the exams.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_097.wav|I hope it comes out all right.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_098.wav|I will just have to be patient.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_099.wav|It's a sensible management decision.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_100.wav|I kept it very simple.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_101.wav|The rest was badminton.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_102.wav|It will take several days.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_103.wav|We had to push to get a goal.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_104.wav|That got me out.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_105.wav|I would just like someone to confess.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_106.wav|We are making progress on waiting lists.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_107.wav|It will have to ratify the deal.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_108.wav|I did not have faith in the procedures.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_109.wav|I was not a joiner.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_110.wav|It has to find out what went wrong.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_111.wav|Until you hit the big games.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_112.wav|It has until Saturday.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_113.wav|I've tried to get on with my life.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_114.wav|She has the biggest part.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_115.wav|We will win this tie.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_116.wav|This is totally untrue.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_117.wav|Or someone wants to say something different.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_118.wav|I think they have to change that.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_119.wav|This series is for real.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_120.wav|It's great news, isn't it.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_121.wav|It's very ingenious.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_122.wav|That would depend on the parole board.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_123.wav|It is all up to the Members.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_124.wav|The two sets are different.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_125.wav|And now the pressure is off.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_126.wav|You can see the appeal of running away.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_127.wav|Their opening was disastrous.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_128.wav|The time is up for Iraq to comply.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_129.wav|There can be no compromise on that demand.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_130.wav|The following are the principal provisions.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_131.wav|Too much has already been said.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_132.wav|Now, however, things are different.|84,,
wav48/p316/p316_133.wav|It was not a beautiful game, was it?|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_134.wav|She is not the world champion.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_135.wav|It would be difficult to argue with that.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_136.wav|While they went on a holiday, we got the contract.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_137.wav|He is a bully.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_138.wav|The case was taken on by his brother.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_139.wav|I've won the British.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_140.wav|And so the cycle continues.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_141.wav|I don't have many friends.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_142.wav|However, it was a different story in the final.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_143.wav|They exist in name alone.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_144.wav|I am not retiring.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_145.wav|All will be revealed in due course.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_146.wav|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_147.wav|And frankly, it's been a while.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_148.wav|Feel for five seconds.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_149.wav|I hope it is a good omen.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_150.wav|Because if it matters to them, it matters to me.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_151.wav|They will appear again next week.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_152.wav|Failure is not an option.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_153.wav|We were not consulted regarding this appointment.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_154.wav|You look at that.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_155.wav|Things begin to spring to life.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_156.wav|Or was it Some kind of a ham?|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_157.wav|I understood that concern.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_158.wav|The things writers and directors say!|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_159.wav|I am prepared to step down.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_160.wav|It was like a dream to be here.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_161.wav|The four characters could be one somebody suggested.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_162.wav|Either way, it doesn't bother me.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_163.wav|It would help to heal the wounds.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_164.wav|We did not deserve to go through.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_165.wav|It's got to be in the head.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_166.wav|It certainly sounded it at times.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_167.wav|It will be too hot.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_168.wav|That happens in boxing.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_169.wav|Consumers will also benefit.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_170.wav|None of the opinions is good.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_171.wav|We were hopeful that it would be successful.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_172.wav|They must not succeed.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_173.wav|He declined to provide a breakdown.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_174.wav|But the foundations have been laid.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_175.wav|I have never seen him like that.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_176.wav|And you need to be so resourceful.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_177.wav|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarerry.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_178.wav|She hopes to study in Britain one day.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_179.wav|Everything in the world was focused on London.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_180.wav|We played better after the break.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_181.wav|But this relative success has not been easy.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_182.wav|It was the same with the Dickens.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_183.wav|Of course it is still possible.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_184.wav|Actually, it's an amazing orchestra.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_185.wav|That, in a way, is the point.|84,,
wav48/p316/p316_186.wav|What is so unusual about this case?|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_187.wav|It is not about the money, it is about everything.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_188.wav|That would end it for us.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_189.wav|Police are treating the incident as attempted murder.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_190.wav|Sure, he is the best player in the world.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_191.wav|I just love lessons.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_192.wav|Retirement is on his mind.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_193.wav|It's to do with this place.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_194.wav|The home side didn't stand a chance.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_195.wav|We shall not be moved.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_196.wav|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_197.wav|It is not just the agencies.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_198.wav|There must be boundaries.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_199.wav|However, he was later released without charge.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_200.wav|Arsenal refused to be evicted.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_201.wav|I watch the other visitors.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_202.wav|Nobody is pushing out to the right.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_204.wav|He confirmed his fitness.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_205.wav|The gap is narrowing.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_206.wav|All of us in Scotland should be viligant.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_207.wav|Both men were uninjured.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_208.wav|My husband was fighting for his life.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_209.wav|It is not a financial issue.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_210.wav|We are in this for the long haul.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_211.wav|We have a budget in March.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_212.wav|There was no respite.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_213.wav|I got very, very tired.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_214.wav|I am really sorry that he is going.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_215.wav|They will do their own thing.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_216.wav|It is too much for me.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_217.wav|But is this enough to provoke a killing?|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_218.wav|I didn't just walk in and get it.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_219.wav|We've made a couple of albums.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_220.wav|We need a much wider debate.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_221.wav|My attitude is exactly the same as before.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_222.wav|Look at a computer.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_223.wav|They went back to the seventeenth.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_224.wav|First, the programme was unbalanced.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_225.wav|So what could be better than becoming a captain?|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_226.wav|However, it proved to be the turning point.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_227.wav|However, everyone should do it once in their life.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_228.wav|In hindsight, it was the wrong decision.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_229.wav|I waited and waited.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_230.wav|We all knew it could not be true.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_231.wav|Its future is uncertain.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_232.wav|I'm very surprised and obviously delighted.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_233.wav|It doesn't look good for her.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_234.wav|She said he did not look too happy.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_235.wav|We are aware of the problem.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_236.wav|Where will the elderly go then?|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_237.wav|Then it was changed without notice.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_238.wav|He had a great game.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_239.wav|The following year, they asked him again.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_240.wav|It is the men who create the demand.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_241.wav|I'm very happy indeed to be almost redundant.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_242.wav|Every case is completely different.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_243.wav|It's a scandal, a disgrace.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_244.wav|Planting is unlikely to start before next spring.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_245.wav|However, he said the money had not been wasted.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_246.wav|It will be fine.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_247.wav|He should emerge as the winner.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_248.wav|They are you, the fans.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_249.wav|We're just waiting for her reaction.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_250.wav|At the end of the day, two men have been shot.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_251.wav|What a difference a game can make.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_252.wav|They will not be able to come back, in my opinion.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_253.wav|Why do it?|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_254.wav|It opened last month.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_255.wav|This will be our new beginning.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_256.wav|If they don't, they might well decide not to play.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_257.wav|I have totally had enough.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_258.wav|Hopefully today will be the turning point.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_259.wav|We shall be ready for Rangers.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_260.wav|It was bound to happen, and it has happened.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_261.wav|There were no reported casualties on the ground.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_262.wav|What are you waiting for?|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_263.wav|In the meantime, everyone is taking everyone to court.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_264.wav|This is still happening in the US.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_265.wav|Another issue will be policing.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_266.wav|Today was first class.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_267.wav|This is the biggest surprise of my life.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_268.wav|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_269.wav|This is a good move for me.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_270.wav|Feel the heat?|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_271.wav|She was so full of life.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_272.wav|I should have given him one in return.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_273.wav|I began to pray.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_274.wav|The princess has strong links with Scotland.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_275.wav|I am very confident about tomorrow night.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_276.wav|I just wanted to fly.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_277.wav|And he has a tale to tell.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_278.wav|Footballers have also been targeted.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_279.wav|The deadline is real and absolute.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_280.wav|So, how did this happen?|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_281.wav|It's all a part of letting it go.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_282.wav|I just hope it's not tonight against us.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_283.wav|There are no quick fixes.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_284.wav|The change was not instant.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_285.wav|We've got the bronze.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_286.wav|They use them for everything.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_287.wav|Who is to benefit from this change?|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_288.wav|We are not defeated.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_289.wav|He knows what he's got to do.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_290.wav|Clearly, the stakes are high.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_291.wav|We have been going for three years.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_292.wav|We deserved the three points.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_293.wav|It is planned for London in the spring.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_294.wav|War and force are not the only solutions.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_295.wav|They would have to go to the Royal.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_296.wav|It didn't matter who was in their way.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_297.wav|Which brings us to the point.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_298.wav|I think it's difficult for Bonnie.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_299.wav|I am quite excited about it.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_300.wav|Everyone agrees with that.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_301.wav|She had denied the charge.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_302.wav|If we live forever, can we really be said to live?|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_303.wav|Sometimes you stand on them as they collapse.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_304.wav|I didn't feel good.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_305.wav|It is believed that he had been stabbed.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_306.wav|It is an expensive part of their equipment.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_307.wav|Let's get to know him.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_308.wav|We have got to attack.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_309.wav|Well, they were the unlucky ones.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_310.wav|Time has run out for Saddam Hussein.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_311.wav|It divided audiences at Cannes.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_312.wav|It's a lovely, lovely film.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_313.wav|How would it work?|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_314.wav|We told them in July.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_315.wav|The film was great.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_316.wav|Venus rejects the very suggestion.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_317.wav|It's a real challenge.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_318.wav|The police believe that the man was not injured.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_319.wav|Everyone in Britain is proud of this team.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_320.wav|There was too much at stake.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_321.wav|I read about it in the newspapers.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_322.wav|What did they think of her voice?|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_323.wav|Is that not uncanny?|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_324.wav|It has to reinvent itself.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_325.wav|It is a good result for Great Britain.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_326.wav|He was happy with his form.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_327.wav|His art was not just about emotions.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_328.wav|Nato was not a love affair.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_329.wav|It's a production company.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_330.wav|But we will not be scared.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_331.wav|But that is not an issue for now.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_332.wav|It will not work in our favour.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_333.wav|It is the wealthiest in Europe.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_334.wav|He is on the wrong side.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_335.wav|That was a disgraceful performance.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_336.wav|There will be no receivers.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_337.wav|My son was too young to die.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_338.wav|The air campaign is not over yet.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_339.wav|It's a national sport.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_340.wav|But this isn't a play about The Troubles.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_341.wav|The picture in Glasgow was improving, he added.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_342.wav|Only New Zealand has seen a similar increase.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_343.wav|I was shocked and outraged.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_344.wav|Not many people like to do that.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_345.wav|It was extremely cold.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_346.wav|Italy would be lukewarm.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_347.wav|People are using it in their daily lives.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_348.wav|Chelsea was a great club.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_349.wav|We have to open up.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_350.wav|She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_351.wav|There is a review outgoing at the moment.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_352.wav|The pensioners did not want to know.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_353.wav|It was just awful.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_354.wav|We are doing okay in the league.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_355.wav|Today the Kremlin would be contacted in seconds.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_356.wav|It is time for concerted national action.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_357.wav|Do you know who we are?|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_358.wav|Souter will be back.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_359.wav|I'd like to report a murder.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_360.wav|I'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_361.wav|It certainly gives you hope.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_362.wav|If he does not leave, he will be shot.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_363.wav|Two people have died.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_364.wav|Fishermen are still in a state of confusion.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_365.wav|I am delighted to have her back home.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_366.wav|Many of them were his friends and colleagues.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_367.wav|It is based on his movement records.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_368.wav|It wasn't an easy decision.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_369.wav|It left me with sadness.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_370.wav|There is a changing of the guard.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_371.wav|The boys are very confident.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_372.wav|It was our time maybe.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_373.wav|I know we can play a lot better.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_374.wav|We said it will happen one night.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_375.wav|It is a flexible concept.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_376.wav|This election is far from over.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_377.wav|So the Government will be damaged.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_378.wav|Ali was shot at, but refused to back down.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_379.wav|However, we let them back into the game.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_380.wav|I have great confidence in Annabelle.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_381.wav|Is that such a bad thing?|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_382.wav|You do need a check and a balance.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_383.wav|Thousands of people were missing.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_384.wav|Maloney is an engaging talent.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_385.wav|It's time to move on.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_386.wav|I couldn't get out of bed.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_387.wav|Mr Campbell received a phone call.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_388.wav|I'm delighted, and the players were brilliant.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_389.wav|I can't describe it.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_390.wav|It changed my life.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_391.wav|But what will we put on it?|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_392.wav|It will benefit a lot of people.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_393.wav|A new school will be built.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_394.wav|There may be hope this year, however.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_395.wav|That is not too bad.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_396.wav|They are taking a stand against this.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_397.wav|They are not left wing.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_398.wav|I was the sheep.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_399.wav|I think we believed the tie was won.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_400.wav|Well, there you go.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_401.wav|How do you find the youngsters?|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_402.wav|It was a great team effort.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_403.wav|In my experience, he does not do that.|84,,,
wav48/p316/p316_404.wav|Mr Forrester reacted angrily.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_405.wav|I am glad that justice has been done.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_406.wav|Its first awards will just do that.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_407.wav|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_408.wav|That is my preference.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_409.wav|Taxation should be simplified.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_410.wav|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_411.wav|It is not that sort of inquiry.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_412.wav|I have signed a contract.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_413.wav|I have never been overly ambitious.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_414.wav|We were beaten by the better team.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_415.wav|I hope you don't regret it.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_416.wav|He was all blackened.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_417.wav|This is your country.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_418.wav|This is the greatest moment of our lives.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_419.wav|Audiences there were shocked.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_420.wav|They responded in the most positive way.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_421.wav|The British government said she was coming home.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_422.wav|We won very easily.|84,,,,
wav48/p316/p316_423.wav|That is a matter for Mr Graham.|84,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_001.wav|Please call Stella.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|85,,
wav48/p317/p317_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|85,,
wav48/p317/p317_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|85,,
wav48/p317/p317_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|85,,
wav48/p317/p317_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|85,,
wav48/p317/p317_025.wav|They have the cash to do that.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_026.wav|There was a fine line to tread.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_027.wav|Yet it is all for two good causes.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_028.wav|It is so elusive and light.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_029.wav|I am not a fan of stoppages.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_030.wav|The council has been open and transparent.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_031.wav|Is the war over?|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_032.wav|The country is in a state of chaos.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_033.wav|But don't expect an easy ride.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_034.wav|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_035.wav|Some US embassy staff have left the country.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_036.wav|It was a policy they were against.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_037.wav|Her mother said she fell off a swing.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_038.wav|We see little sign of improvement.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_039.wav|The study, carried out by the consumer magazine Which?|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_040.wav|The gaffer was great.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_041.wav|Overall, however, these were also down.|85,,
wav48/p317/p317_042.wav|Ten years on, that advice is beginning to pay dividends.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_043.wav|Had she enjoyed the experience?|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_044.wav|I feel very sad and extremely cut up.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_045.wav|She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_046.wav|I would think they are just behind them.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_047.wav|We then went to see the headmaster.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_048.wav|As far as we are concerned, he is innocent anyway.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_049.wav|There is no mandate for a regime change.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_050.wav|He did the right thing by ignoring me.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_051.wav|These men are a part of India.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_052.wav|Are we going to stay up?|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_053.wav|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_054.wav|I am going home to see my children.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_055.wav|New potential dangers were emerging.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_056.wav|That tells you something about them.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_057.wav|The father was treated like a criminal, and why?|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_058.wav|I am a drug addict.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_059.wav|I've had to take time off work today.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_060.wav|The problem is the book.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_061.wav|There was no basis for their arrest.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_062.wav|This wasn't just a big crowd.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_063.wav|I wondered about changing back to rugby.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_064.wav|They say he wants to go to England.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_065.wav|They are the partner of choice for anyone.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_066.wav|Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_067.wav|Wagner was never like this.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_068.wav|It is an attitude of mind.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_069.wav|How do you resurrect a dying town?|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_070.wav|And what does it cost, and who is paying?|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_071.wav|I've come here for the jersey.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_072.wav|This is not an optional extra.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_073.wav|This is not the most crucial issue.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_074.wav|We don't know much, but we are still awaiting news.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_075.wav|It's that sort of night.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_076.wav|Morale is very high, despite the growing risks.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_077.wav|Will we ever play together again?|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_078.wav|It's been a terrible ordeal for Margaret.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_079.wav|I played well but missed a few chances.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_080.wav|That must be left to the Parole Board.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_081.wav|I'm so proud of my team.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_082.wav|They have a way of proclaiming themselves.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_083.wav|That would open the gates of hell.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_084.wav|This has not, and has been neglected.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_085.wav|McNaughton was not so sure.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_086.wav|What did you learn in school today?|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_087.wav|If you're a national company, you must provide it all.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_088.wav|We will see how he is after treatment.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_089.wav|This is rapidly becoming a fiasco.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_090.wav|There is no signature on this document.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_091.wav|We could not compete with Rangers.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_092.wav|In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_093.wav|But they must serve their sentence in Scotland.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_094.wav|He was critically ill in hospital last night.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_095.wav|However, it is much bigger than that.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_096.wav|One season, they might do well.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_097.wav|Our approach will be different.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_098.wav|Too much has already been said.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_099.wav|He asked me in a tolerance zone.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_100.wav|But don't worry just yet.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_101.wav|This championship is different from the other majors.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_102.wav|For now, though, my future is with Rangers.|85,,
wav48/p317/p317_103.wav|I drove the ball well.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_104.wav|If so, how does it intend to achieve this result?|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_105.wav|His handling raises a wider issue.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_106.wav|We have got the school holidays on.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_107.wav|This is not a recipe for conflict.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_108.wav|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_109.wav|We understand the changes in the world.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_110.wav|It is a potential factor.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_111.wav|This is the big one.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_112.wav|That just wasn't good enough.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_113.wav|The company has other problems with the shells.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_114.wav|The working families tax credit is far better.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_115.wav|He had done his homework properly.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_116.wav|Then, as we know too well, anything can happen.|85,,
wav48/p317/p317_117.wav|We must get the three points.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_118.wav|Players were held in equally low regard.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_119.wav|I was in the train station overnight.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_120.wav|It's to do with context.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_121.wav|Now we need to keep our heads up.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_122.wav|Our home is your home.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_123.wav|It is essential that we win the game.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_124.wav|There was no confusion over the second.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_125.wav|Alan Milburn, the health secretary, refused to comment.|85,,
wav48/p317/p317_126.wav|A decision is expected shortly.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_127.wav|Hear what they have to say.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_128.wav|I haven't just gone in, done a three-hour rehearsal, and gone.|85,,
wav48/p317/p317_129.wav|You would be wrong.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_130.wav|Motorists will buy passes in advance.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_131.wav|Mr Wilson had two brothers and three sisters.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_132.wav|I think it is wide open.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_133.wav|They too refused to come out and talk.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_134.wav|We took the chances when they came.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_135.wav|It is important that vital services are maintained.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_136.wav|These services may also have to be cut.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_137.wav|Tony Blair's official spokesman said.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_138.wav|The captaincy will help that, too.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_139.wav|We can't have it both ways.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_140.wav|Actors stand still in the frame.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_141.wav|Who honestly expected anything else?|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_142.wav|We are so, so lucky, so many people have died.|85,,
wav48/p317/p317_143.wav|MOVIE stars are public property.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_144.wav|They never looked like winning it either.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_145.wav|A Foreign Office spokesman declined to comment.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_146.wav|No details of the talks were given.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_147.wav|The group is separate from the Real IRA.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_148.wav|It was a wilful act of violence.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_149.wav|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_150.wav|We never got off the bus.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_151.wav|The driver escaped injury.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_152.wav|T, Is there anything in the wound?|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_153.wav|They should be looking at his victims.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_154.wav|We told them in June.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_155.wav|It's all about money, money, money.|85,,
wav48/p317/p317_156.wav|I won't make an official complaint.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_157.wav|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_158.wav|The research is published in the journal, Nature.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_159.wav|She is a double victim.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_160.wav|How can you not react?|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_161.wav|They make a selective perception process.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_162.wav|There can be no compromise on that demand.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_163.wav|I am totally devoted to this job.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_164.wav|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_165.wav|There was an e-mail.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_166.wav|That is a lot of writing.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_167.wav|I try to be open to experience.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_168.wav|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_169.wav|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.|85,,
wav48/p317/p317_170.wav|It is no place for a poet.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_171.wav|This is excellent value for money.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_172.wav|Each day is a new beginning.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_173.wav|My daughter is an adult.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_174.wav|It obviously changes the prospects for getting agreement.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_175.wav|They are difficult awards to decide.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_176.wav|Thereafter he left Scotland.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_177.wav|We've come from a long way back.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_178.wav|A lot of things can go wrong.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_179.wav|I was delighted with Robbie.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_180.wav|He seemed to lose his focus.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_181.wav|I'll just do my best.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_182.wav|Three penalties were given.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_183.wav|And the World Cup has not even begun.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_184.wav|The police were called in.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_185.wav|The group would never be the same again.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_186.wav|Aye, but who do you really support?|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_187.wav|She was eight months pregnant at the time.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_188.wav|This is not a birthday party.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_189.wav|This makes no sense!|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_190.wav|It's a drop in the bucket.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_191.wav|I've had a hard time, to be honest.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_192.wav|He said that this is beautiful.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_193.wav|During the communist time they were very privileged.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_194.wav|That option cannot be ruled out.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_195.wav|Women were mostly notable by their absence.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_196.wav|Everyone needs a holiday, even the Salvation Army.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_197.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.|85,,
wav48/p317/p317_198.wav|Three years probation is just a joke.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_199.wav|That's how she wants to remember him.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_200.wav|How do you respond to losing your child?|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_201.wav|Who is the employer?|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_202.wav|This is the biggest thing in the world, isn't it?|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_203.wav|Mr Smith was dismissive.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_204.wav|McMaster is keen to draw attention to others.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_205.wav|Pressure of work is no excuse.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_206.wav|On this form, they have a real chance of going up.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_207.wav|Two charges of threatening crew members were dropped.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_208.wav|Would he be able to live with that?|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_209.wav|However, what is his calibre?|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_210.wav|I COULD hardly keep up with Professor McKean.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_211.wav|Our plans for Dunfermline have not changed.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_212.wav|It's a production company.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_213.wav|No other vehicle was involved in the incident.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_214.wav|She died in middle age.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_215.wav|They do the work, you know.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_216.wav|There will be plenty to keep them occupied.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_217.wav|We are in the hat.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_218.wav|We were a load of rubbish.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_219.wav|Thus far we have received no complaints.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_220.wav|I haven't made the donation yet.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_221.wav|Other people also tried.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_222.wav|But Harry has become a franchise.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_223.wav|He is at war with his knee.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_224.wav|I could go on, but none of these things is true.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_225.wav|I can't deny that fact.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_226.wav|Clubs can only do so much.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_227.wav|It's unsafe for society.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_228.wav|Seaman is not the goalkeeper of old.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_229.wav|It would have very little impact on them.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_230.wav|It would still have been a good film, but very different.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_231.wav|But, in the end, he did - and blew him away.|85,,
wav48/p317/p317_232.wav|I will be having talks with the workforce.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_233.wav|I don't care to recall it.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_234.wav|That's the whole idea.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_235.wav|They showed a lot of heart.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_236.wav|Michael, he is running!|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_237.wav|My life is a mess.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_238.wav|He did not report it.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_239.wav|You must be ready to play anyone.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_240.wav|For example they could be in school uniform.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_241.wav|Surely the panel was interested?|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_242.wav|They were even being used by primary pupils.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_243.wav|It's like English in its underwear.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_244.wav|This event allows us to emphasise the positive.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_245.wav|I now know that from memory.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_246.wav|We need to tighten up.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_247.wav|I saw it at a ruck.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_248.wav|This is a huge event.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_249.wav|Just get on with your job.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_250.wav|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.|85,,
wav48/p317/p317_251.wav|That decision was applauded by Williamson.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_252.wav|You are not going in blind.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_253.wav|They just made me feel dizzy.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_254.wav|He must have sat down, relieved it was over.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_255.wav|He will do so today in Monte Carlo.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_256.wav|The man was pronounced dead on arrival.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_257.wav|Health care workers and labourers followed.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_258.wav|Blair also faces pressure from within the cabinet.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_259.wav|We have great confidence in Derek.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_260.wav|It puts the thought out, for other people to think about.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_261.wav|We are not too surprised.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_262.wav|There were no new cases yesterday.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_263.wav|If only the problems concerned the players.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_264.wav|It will be an eye for an eye.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_265.wav|Whatever happened to that one?|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_266.wav|There were no proposals on the table.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_267.wav|I have spoken to head office.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_268.wav|Here the National Gallery has been very clever.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_269.wav|Do you want a cup of tea.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_270.wav|Three further cases were confirmed yesterday in Scotland.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_271.wav|We have all been shocked by her death.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_272.wav|We are asking the council to think again.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_273.wav|We are committed to urgent action.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_274.wav|Hopefully, now we're getting it.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_275.wav|I am totally surprised.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_276.wav|Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_277.wav|But someone forgot to tell the Chechens.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_278.wav|The bookies have got it about right.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_279.wav|There's not much money in cycling.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_280.wav|It was always open for extension.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_281.wav|I think we're very different.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_282.wav|For starters, many of the Scotland team didn't turn up.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_283.wav|The way forward is working with other disciplines.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_284.wav|And that is not a bad idea.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_285.wav|He also has a house in Italy.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_286.wav|Blood samples were taken.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_287.wav|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_288.wav|Scotland need to work on two key areas.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_289.wav|It's so creative and different.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_290.wav|They are in care for a reason.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_291.wav|They refused to fire on their own countrymen.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_292.wav|In my opinion it was a mistake, and never on purpose.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_293.wav|Obviously, Airbus is one of these.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_294.wav|It got no better.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_295.wav|I keep my fingers crossed.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_296.wav|Some were close to tears.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_297.wav|It would then be up to the judge.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_298.wav|Was all this really just five months ago?|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_299.wav|Some reports said they had been killed.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_300.wav|This is the start of a new campaign.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_301.wav|It is scheduled to go ahead next Saturday.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_302.wav|The failings are serious.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_303.wav|It is like a bereavement.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_304.wav|I shouldn't have to put up with it.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_305.wav|It could have been just a quick fix.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_306.wav|I got on very well with Allan.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_307.wav|That has given me great confidence.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_308.wav|This is a dream come true for me.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_309.wav|No other country has ever won this tournament.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_310.wav|However, there could be more bad weather to come.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_311.wav|He was lying face down in the water.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_312.wav|He confirmed there had been no warning.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_313.wav|Ferguson did not hesitate.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_314.wav|Managers and clinicians must work together.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_315.wav|They didn't have a care in the world.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_316.wav|I was in the zone in the morning.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_317.wav|He urged people to forgive.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_318.wav|In fact, it might just be beginning.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_319.wav|So he is open to ideas.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_320.wav|Central to their cause was Barry Nicholson.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_321.wav|Not that anyone has actually suffered, for her art.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_322.wav|There is no right to appeal.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_323.wav|We are expected to do better than before.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_324.wav|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_325.wav|I am not even thinking about that.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_326.wav|Scotland is one of the favourites, with Glasgow to the fore.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_327.wav|The World Trade Centre was our Main Street.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_328.wav|It is good for their eyesight.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_329.wav|I feel it is very irrational.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_330.wav|It wasn't a flashy performance, it was very workmanlike.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_331.wav|It is still with Ministers.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_332.wav|The effect was almost magical.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_333.wav|Everything is obviously in the very early stages.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_334.wav|We are not doing the Today programme.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_335.wav|It's not that difficult, it really isn't.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_336.wav|She was charged with perjury.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_337.wav|I was not a joiner.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_338.wav|The sleeper was six hours late.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_339.wav|Tax is a matter for national governments.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_340.wav|Stewart will travel with some confidence.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_341.wav|Sunday's game was not a trial.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_342.wav|They were average apart, together superb.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_343.wav|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_344.wav|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_345.wav|That never seemed likely.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_346.wav|A decision is expected next March.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_347.wav|We don't believe anything anymore.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_348.wav|I am awaiting a reply.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_349.wav|There was no need for such a hostel.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_350.wav|This comes down to a problem of arrogance.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_351.wav|Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_352.wav|There's no doubt about it.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_353.wav|It just came into my head that day.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_354.wav|We've always had a very positive attitude.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_355.wav|What's a boy to do?|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_356.wav|We're not an employment agency.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_357.wav|The other was the tabloids.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_358.wav|They should be swept away.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_359.wav|They thought the set-up there was unfair.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_360.wav|I am saddened to hear of the accident.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_361.wav|We want to replicate that success.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_362.wav|We were lucky to have survived.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_363.wav|Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.|85,,
wav48/p317/p317_364.wav|I am very happy to be here.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_365.wav|He would help me with the form.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_366.wav|We could easily be cut again.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_367.wav|That meant the search was unlawful.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_368.wav|And he goes with it.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_369.wav|The actors just have to say so.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_370.wav|Someone else can do the cooking that night.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_371.wav|I am so lucky for that.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_372.wav|It broke up my marriage.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_373.wav|He planned to relocate to Scotland, probably Edinburgh.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_374.wav|The minister is the engineer.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_375.wav|After that, it's a step into the unknown.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_376.wav|I think it was briefly considered.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_377.wav|And Rangers think they have problems.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_378.wav|We talk to each other about these matters.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_379.wav|It's a hidden problem.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_380.wav|They serve a multitude of purposes.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_381.wav|There will be two other areas of contention.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_382.wav|I lost a part of me.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_383.wav|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.|85,,
wav48/p317/p317_384.wav|Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_385.wav|But he has strong links to Labour.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_386.wav|Bob Dylan is getting old.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_387.wav|I never thought it would take this long.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_388.wav|And he is immensely loyal.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_389.wav|It will only work with changes in lifestyle.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_390.wav|They think that it matters but it doesn't.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_391.wav|This looks like it is anything but open.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_392.wav|My only ambition is to enjoy my work.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_393.wav|She kept him on a string.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_394.wav|The committees are due to report next year.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_395.wav|It's a long-term solution.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_396.wav|That doesn't mean the Cabinet has to endorse.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_397.wav|What's the theme?|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_398.wav|He takes his time, and won't be rushed.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_399.wav|It shows that painting is still relevant.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_400.wav|It's a very special unit.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_401.wav|The deadline for selecting the electors is today.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_402.wav|Davis is very supportive, as a director.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_403.wav|However, the groups denied the claims.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_404.wav|It's only tackling congestion.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_405.wav|And our game is about going forward.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_406.wav|They will have to cut through the roof.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_407.wav|Then there's one where people play for fun.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_408.wav|That's the law of the land.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_409.wav|They have enough intrusion at the time.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_410.wav|What's wrong with that?|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_411.wav|This wasn't something we wanted to rush into.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_412.wav|Then one night only three people turn up.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_413.wav|The parents will have a great time, too.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_414.wav|Now we see the impact of global politics.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_415.wav|The figures are bad, but not that bad.|85,,,
wav48/p317/p317_416.wav|This was not the show for me.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_417.wav|The police have to act to help them.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_418.wav|She was extremely rigid.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_419.wav|Neither side can win this war.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_420.wav|Borrowing power was one of those improvements.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_421.wav|We do not, at the moment, have a shortage.|85,,
wav48/p317/p317_422.wav|Appointments should be made on merit.|85,,,,
wav48/p317/p317_423.wav|Manchester United are the classic example.|85,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_001.wav|Please call Stella.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we can go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|86,,
wav48/p318/p318_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|86,,
wav48/p318/p318_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|86,,
wav48/p318/p318_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|86,,
wav48/p318/p318_025.wav|They will be dealt with.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_026.wav|It is never an easy game.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_027.wav|This year it will be Billy Crystal.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_028.wav|I intend to raise the matter there.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_029.wav|However, it's good to turn the page.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_030.wav|We have to put this behind us.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_031.wav|I thought it was quite good.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_032.wav|It was important to win the singles.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_033.wav|This is a disaster averted for Scotland.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_034.wav|That is impressive by any standards.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_035.wav|We are doing very well as we are.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_036.wav|The waiting is over, well almost.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_037.wav|This was the performance, and the result they needed.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_038.wav|I'm not allowed to say that, of course.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_039.wav|It helped to get me noticed.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_040.wav|They hit me in the head.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_041.wav|But he is not using them.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_042.wav|That, though, was just the start of it.|86,,
wav48/p318/p318_043.wav|We are not moving in.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_044.wav|We have not had a formal request.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_045.wav|I never had a childhood.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_046.wav|Its effect on humans is not yet known.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_047.wav|We offered something different.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_048.wav|We were very much a happy family.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_049.wav|He was critically ill in hospital last night.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_050.wav|My brother is buried under there.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_051.wav|Their conditions are described as serious but stable.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_052.wav|What were they?|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_053.wav|It was large enough to fit the wall.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_054.wav|He will be judged by his actions.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_055.wav|Her role in it was small.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_056.wav|I have really noticed that this week.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_057.wav|We might be back next year.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_058.wav|In a way he was.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_059.wav|It's back to how it used to be.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_060.wav|It is not a standing army.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_061.wav|The firm was down and almost out.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_062.wav|They said they were only young men.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_063.wav|I was chosen to do this.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_064.wav|I learned a lot from that.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_065.wav|The house was so well alight.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_066.wav|He got his degree.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_067.wav|Sandy was very active.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_068.wav|However, there is great potential in this right.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_069.wav|We have no idea what caused the derailment.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_070.wav|I am confident of the outcome this week.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_071.wav|There were no formal announcements.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_072.wav|Before the games it was pretty open.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_073.wav|It really has left the town in shock.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_074.wav|But you can go beyond that condition.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_075.wav|I'm so worried about the roads.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_076.wav|This was much worse.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_077.wav|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_078.wav|We are confident of taking that back.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_079.wav|They must be kept on the ground.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_080.wav|Did they give any good advice?|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_081.wav|Who wants to be a millionaire?|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_082.wav|This does not help.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_083.wav|I've invented a village in East Lothian.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_084.wav|That's why the ministers resigned.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_085.wav|He has lost confidence and weight.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_086.wav|This process of attrition is expected to continue.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_087.wav|Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_088.wav|This could be her way forward.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_089.wav|This gives us a lot of practice.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_090.wav|The Parliament will make its own decisions.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_091.wav|It's a very, very special day.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_092.wav|The crucial strike was yet to come.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_093.wav|There's also the point.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_094.wav|It was forced to divert.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_095.wav|Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_096.wav|That's the National Grid.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_097.wav|But Allen is deadly serious.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_098.wav|Peter doesn't want to leave.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_099.wav|He wouldn't allow that to happen.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_100.wav|They have just got to believe in themselves.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_101.wav|This is my personal assessment.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_102.wav|There was no trouble at all.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_103.wav|Although, you never know.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_104.wav|We shall be victorious.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_105.wav|The quality of work is very impressive.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_106.wav|However, he added there were signs of progress.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_107.wav|Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.|86,,
wav48/p318/p318_108.wav|I think the Scottish bid is very strong.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_109.wav|Nothing is being offered in exchange.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_110.wav|I took the gun.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_111.wav|It's just one of those things.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_112.wav|A web site is planned for November.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_113.wav|We played so well at times.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_114.wav|I was very fortunate.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_115.wav|Such a policy would be a disaster.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_116.wav|We act because we must.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_117.wav|They will be destroyed.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_118.wav|We didn't get the supply to the forwards.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_119.wav|O Neill is reputed to have replied.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_120.wav|The Tory party will last.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_121.wav|It was a journey into a new life.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_122.wav|It's a way of making a mark.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_123.wav|There is a great carry over value.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_124.wav|Life, as many people know it, in other words.|86,,
wav48/p318/p318_125.wav|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_126.wav|What's the point?|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_127.wav|Why is this?|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_128.wav|What has changed since then?|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_129.wav|Raymond was always on the outside.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_130.wav|We need to make more inquiries about that.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_131.wav|I'd love to be at the World Cup.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_132.wav|He is expected to be interviewed by detectives.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_133.wav|I am sorry to hear this news.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_134.wav|At some point, the bill will be presented.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_135.wav|I mean it happens.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_136.wav|This week is a perfect example.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_137.wav|This performance has given my confidence a boost.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_138.wav|Receiving this medal is an honour.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_139.wav|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_140.wav|But every two minutes it was exploding.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_141.wav|That sort of thing is long gone.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_142.wav|It is typical of me.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_143.wav|However, consumers may take a different view.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_144.wav|They played it like a cup final.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_145.wav|However, it is not all bad news for women.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_146.wav|But the championship is not over yet.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_147.wav|We haven't found out anything different.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_148.wav|A review of the decision is being sought.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_149.wav|It will be about commitment, not compliance.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_150.wav|Still, in the end, it was a fair result.|86,,
wav48/p318/p318_151.wav|Surely it can do better than that?|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_152.wav|I am ashamed of them.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_153.wav|Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.|86,,
wav48/p318/p318_154.wav|The salary changes are long overdue.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_155.wav|I, like an idiot, agreed.|86,,
wav48/p318/p318_156.wav|If so, we want to hear from them.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_157.wav|I am not blaming audiences.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_158.wav|Who was on the panel?|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_159.wav|They may differ on other issues.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_160.wav|He had never run the distance before.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_161.wav|I can make one further announcement.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_162.wav|The General Election is all to play for.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_163.wav|It was a fiery game.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_164.wav|Agents and coaches must be paid.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_165.wav|Golf is a game of honour and ethics.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_166.wav|Obviously, a lot has changed for me since then.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_167.wav|It will not be easy for him.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_168.wav|This one is a special case.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_169.wav|But what are the songs about?|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_170.wav|There is a simmering anger out there.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_171.wav|The ministers are now to make their decision.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_172.wav|That is not a position they enjoy.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_173.wav|The stadium was full.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_174.wav|Dewar is the medium.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_175.wav|It was that kind of night.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_176.wav|It is very much a matter for them.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_177.wav|Perhaps it is jealousy.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_178.wav|Any error is severely punished.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_179.wav|He's got a great chance of making it.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_180.wav|We won't do that.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_181.wav|I hope we do.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_182.wav|From now on there is no hiding place.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_183.wav|I didn't want to ignore the punters.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_184.wav|He quit in October.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_185.wav|The United Nations must act.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_186.wav|Sponsors include the Sunday Herald.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_187.wav|Her daughter is getting married.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_188.wav|His manager blamed the referee.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_189.wav|They were that poor.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_190.wav|Patients will be partners in decision making.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_191.wav|We have understood the problems for some time.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_192.wav|Stan is a vital part of our future.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_193.wav|All these things have an impact.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_194.wav|That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_195.wav|They believed it worked.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_196.wav|After that, though, we are still waiting to see.|86,,
wav48/p318/p318_197.wav|They should feel ashamed.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_198.wav|This is a really serious issue.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_199.wav|So they will settle again.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_200.wav|How do we get more people in?|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_201.wav|I'm just looking to take my chances.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_202.wav|It looks as though there is no chance.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_203.wav|This is not a European Army.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_204.wav|Election results are expected soon.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_205.wav|So she told him.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_206.wav|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_207.wav|There are moments of honesty, too.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_208.wav|It was good to score the goal today.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_209.wav|The night is young.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_210.wav|Sadly, too, many of them are similar.|86,,
wav48/p318/p318_211.wav|I suspect that it will.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_212.wav|But there's no eye contact.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_213.wav|The squad will be the same for France.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_214.wav|We are a party for people, not against people.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_215.wav|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_216.wav|We are still paying the price for that.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_217.wav|He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_218.wav|It is not a wish list.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_219.wav|He's very, very lucky to be alive.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_220.wav|Some of the players have not progressed.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_221.wav|It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_222.wav|If not, he should go home.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_223.wav|We remain committed to it, as does the government.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_224.wav|There is no margin for error.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_225.wav|This was not an easy meeting for me.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_226.wav|From our point of view, it is the right time.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_227.wav|That figure will always remain with me.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_228.wav|And then a funny thing happened.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_229.wav|It does not take much.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_230.wav|She asked us a lot of questions.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_231.wav|It was a stunning strike.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_232.wav|It is a technique.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_233.wav|They hold on for many years.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_234.wav|Is it the shape of things to come?|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_235.wav|My body is exhausted.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_236.wav|Home is in the Scottish Borders.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_237.wav|We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_238.wav|There is nothing to fear.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_239.wav|I was an athlete.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_240.wav|Life was like a timetable.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_241.wav|World leaders expressed their sympathy.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_242.wav|I tried to push him away.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_243.wav|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_244.wav|This was done by the council staff.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_245.wav|The truth is otherwise.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_246.wav|We haven't come out of this very well.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_247.wav|I wanted to put myself on the line.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_248.wav|I thought they could have made the gesture.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_249.wav|We should be rewarded for producing.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_250.wav|The bottom line is that this must stop.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_251.wav|Which, in effect, it is.|86,,
wav48/p318/p318_252.wav|The man became a reporter.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_253.wav|It is a memorial.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_254.wav|We feel it sends out the wrong message.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_255.wav|Our people are paying high prices.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_256.wav|The reason is partly because of tradition.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_257.wav|Nor is it likely to do so.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_258.wav|Or so everyone believed.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_259.wav|Perhaps we should do the same.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_260.wav|I read it every year.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_261.wav|He was in contention almost every week.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_262.wav|Every school in Scotland should be excellent.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_263.wav|It is up to Ann.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_264.wav|We are playing them at their own game.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_265.wav|By this point the couple were approaching fast.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_266.wav|I had trouble with the producers.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_267.wav|So, it took me back to boarding school.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_268.wav|They just thought it was extremely good acting.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_269.wav|The conference is the first test.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_270.wav|That's what we're trying to achieve.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_271.wav|I expect a rapid response.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_272.wav|There was still more disquiet in Israel.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_273.wav|There is no more money.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_274.wav|My mother is a widow.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_275.wav|The rubble was right up to the ceiling.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_276.wav|There have been different reports from different people.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_277.wav|It's an absolute disgrace.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_278.wav|Something was plainly wrong.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_279.wav|Why should he go anywhere?|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_280.wav|One thing is sure.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_281.wav|It was a foolhardy decision.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_282.wav|I'm confident we can do that.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_283.wav|Funding needs to be long term.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_284.wav|It's funny how it comes and goes.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_285.wav|I would never even consider it.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_286.wav|We are talking about the outskirts of London.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_287.wav|The end result is precisely the same.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_288.wav|We have it on video.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_289.wav|I am not a threat to coaches.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_290.wav|Painful, but only because it's true.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_291.wav|It's never over until it's over.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_292.wav|Colonel, About this committee that is coming.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_293.wav|This year, it was a little different.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_294.wav|That, though, is to miss the point.|86,,
wav48/p318/p318_295.wav|We gave them the goal.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_296.wav|Is being naturally funny enough?|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_297.wav|What's the point of staying sober?|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_298.wav|We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_299.wav|The incident is being taken seriously.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_300.wav|So what's the shape, and what's the detail?|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_301.wav|They were going through the motions, but that's about all.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_302.wav|I can feel the sound inside.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_303.wav|I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_304.wav|I am not a fan of books.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_305.wav|SO now we know the secret.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_306.wav|It may well have been.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_307.wav|I never had any confidence in it afterwards.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_308.wav|It was a simple question.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_309.wav|I find this ongoing debate is demeaning.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_310.wav|And we have beaten them before.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_311.wav|Could you put it in writing?|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_312.wav|I am not a paedophile.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_313.wav|Some of their movement was excellent.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_314.wav|But they had to be paid for.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_315.wav|The odds are that it will.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_316.wav|But then they scored their fourth.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_317.wav|They deserve a lot of credit.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_318.wav|That is the position the MoD has adopted.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_319.wav|Why is that?|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_320.wav|Then came the crunch.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_321.wav|But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_322.wav|But will they fall in love?|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_323.wav|As if they ever stopped.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_324.wav|The referee had a shocking game.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_325.wav|Players are fighting to stay in the team.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_326.wav|For a few years we had good fun.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_327.wav|Medical staff are with them at the moment.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_328.wav|It went on to become an annual event.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_329.wav|This is the logic of punishment assaults.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_330.wav|We are now in an election period.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_331.wav|Everyone is too upset to comment.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_332.wav|Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_333.wav|But when we do it is great.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_334.wav|She has nothing to say to journalists.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_335.wav|I didn't want to fall out with anyone.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_336.wav|He pleaded for caution.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_337.wav|I disagree entirely with the decision.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_338.wav|They've been wonderful to me.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_339.wav|I can't believe the buzz.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_340.wav|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_341.wav|The picture is the same across Scotland.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_342.wav|When it comes down to it, this is a job.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_343.wav|It's no less intriguing, however.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_344.wav|It's a question of perception.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_345.wav|Staff have been informed.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_346.wav|My heart is not so sure.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_347.wav|This morning was very quiet.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_348.wav|On reflection, it was really quite exciting.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_349.wav|It has been handled entirely properly.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_350.wav|I shall be voting Yes to support him.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_351.wav|That might help a bit.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_352.wav|Two others were also seriously injured.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_353.wav|He was made redundant in February last year.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_354.wav|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_355.wav|Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_356.wav|You have obviously got an answer to it.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_357.wav|It seems very odd.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_358.wav|Closure is not one of them.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_359.wav|The hotel was huge.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_360.wav|A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_361.wav|Well, you can have a tree.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_362.wav|It was the same at Twickenham.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_363.wav|This is an internal matter.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_364.wav|I am amazed at what he's done.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_365.wav|They took a risk.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_366.wav|The idea was presented to me.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_367.wav|The hearing in Edinburgh continues.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_368.wav|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_369.wav|His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_370.wav|The hearing was fair.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_371.wav|I see it as my job.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_372.wav|This was not a summit about the euro.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_373.wav|Frank Warren is a great man.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_374.wav|I am a little bit tired.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_375.wav|That was never their agenda.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_376.wav|She died at her home.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_377.wav|She is currently in foster care.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_378.wav|That's the only thing that matters.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_379.wav|I enjoy the creative process.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_380.wav|They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_381.wav|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.|86,,
wav48/p318/p318_382.wav|As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_383.wav|It's always the same, isn't it?|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_384.wav|We have been preparing all year.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_385.wav|We could learn a lot from them.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_386.wav|I can't wait for the outdoors.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_387.wav|Sure, we have problems.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_388.wav|I was released after six days.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_389.wav|That time is not far away.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_390.wav|I may think about performing it.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_391.wav|There are a number of possible outcomes.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_392.wav|We also enjoyed a lot of support.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_393.wav|This is the last thing we ever expected.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_394.wav|You can't go back and change things.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_395.wav|It is time to fight a decisive battle.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_396.wav|Of course, it is a tough assignment.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_397.wav|Instead, it is back to the drawing board.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_398.wav|He says it often enough.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_399.wav|Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_400.wav|His primary residence is Scotland.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_401.wav|I found that much more challenging.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_402.wav|This fight is not going to go away.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_403.wav|It would have been very easily done.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_404.wav|I will never manage another Scottish club.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_405.wav|The Open champion is back.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_406.wav|It's going to be a new challenge.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_407.wav|As, indeed, they would be.|86,,
wav48/p318/p318_408.wav|I want to keep him.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_409.wav|He deserves a top team.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_410.wav|I knew people on that committee.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_411.wav|The next eight weeks are critical to us.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_412.wav|Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_413.wav|Her grand-daughter was uninjured.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_414.wav|We never agreed to it.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_415.wav|But that night they killed her housekeeper.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_416.wav|But it's not the end of Scottish football.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_417.wav|Sightings were replaced by rumours.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_418.wav|Would they work together again?|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_419.wav|I didn't play all that well.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_420.wav|Who can tell?|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_421.wav|It appears to have been closed down.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_422.wav|Now, that is a good deal.|86,,,
wav48/p318/p318_423.wav|The whole nation will be delighted.|86,,,,
wav48/p318/p318_424.wav|We have no plans for direct action.|86,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_001.wav|Please call Stella.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|87,,
wav48/p323/p323_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|87,,
wav48/p323/p323_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|87,,
wav48/p323/p323_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|87,,
wav48/p323/p323_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|87,,
wav48/p323/p323_025.wav|We've made a couple of albums.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_026.wav|Film music was never the same again.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_027.wav|It was a deeply moving musical experience.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_028.wav|Now it is much easier.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_029.wav|However, on the other hand, in principle it is plainly wrong.|87,,
wav48/p323/p323_030.wav|This is the best way to do it.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_031.wav|Its role is not to interfere.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_032.wav|Leisure centres were also affected.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_033.wav|Something happened on that island.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_034.wav|Meantime, the department is proposing structural changes.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_035.wav|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.|87,,
wav48/p323/p323_036.wav|It is misleading to compare the two.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_037.wav|They discussed how he might get involved.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_038.wav|And this perception might find an unlikely supporter.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_039.wav|And it had two seats.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_040.wav|They were not up to speed.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_041.wav|We know the quality of life goes up.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_042.wav|What is next?|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_043.wav|Now they have found out the truth.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_044.wav|We've still got a say in this.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_045.wav|The first was excluding Sinn Fein.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_046.wav|Horses are drawn by ballot.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_047.wav|We have our supporters and our enemies.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_048.wav|Mackie was at home, unable to watch.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_049.wav|So, what's it about?|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_050.wav|We have been let down by these people.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_051.wav|What's it for?|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_052.wav|Nor does he have any desire to be.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_053.wav|How well did they get on?|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_054.wav|I don't think it is a drawback.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_055.wav|He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_056.wav|They may have been murdered.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_057.wav|However this weekend it will be different.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_058.wav|We didn't try hard enough, that is all.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_059.wav|It also condemned the suicide bombers.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_060.wav|I think that's a bit of an invasion.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_061.wav|It is very difficult.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_062.wav|This is the place to play football.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_063.wav|But it was a great decision he joked.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_064.wav|Then they killed another three.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_065.wav|What the Department of Transport will make clear.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_066.wav|The six others were injured.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_067.wav|Most of the others were in their twenties.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_068.wav|We were beaten by the better team today.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_069.wav|You need a long-term strategy in football.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_070.wav|They are not the answer to staff shortages.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_071.wav|The law has got to be upheld.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_072.wav|Advice and counselling will be offered.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_073.wav|I mean they have just been a disaster.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_074.wav|He's a joy to follow.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_075.wav|That is my personal view.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_076.wav|He had just returned to Thailand from Canada.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_077.wav|I saw the explosion and panicked.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_078.wav|The protest will go ahead as planned.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_079.wav|The punishment was swift.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_080.wav|Who will run the bigger show?|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_081.wav|General, You didn't get a modified.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_082.wav|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_083.wav|These things just happen.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_084.wav|And, within itself, it is visionary.|87,,
wav48/p323/p323_085.wav|Are you up for business?|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_086.wav|It's an interesting debate to get going.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_087.wav|Who does he think will win?|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_088.wav|I enjoyed my work in the Scottish Office.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_089.wav|An announcement will follow in due course.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_090.wav|You are not in any kind of trouble.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_091.wav|It also makes for interesting viewing.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_092.wav|Will they fall out?|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_093.wav|Scotland came very close in the second Test.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_094.wav|He was not able to talk to us.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_095.wav|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.|87,,
wav48/p323/p323_096.wav|There is no conflict of interest.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_097.wav|They want to shut the Scottish Office.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_098.wav|They are not suitable.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_099.wav|It does seem a mystery.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_100.wav|But he is something special, is he not?|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_101.wav|Club rugby refuses to die.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_102.wav|That respect is missing in the Netherlands.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_103.wav|He could look after himself, but didn't.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_104.wav|The decision was designed to shock investors.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_105.wav|There's always a solution, somewhere you can meet in the middle.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_106.wav|We are not dealing here with refugees.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_107.wav|It's up to their parents to choose.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_108.wav|I've had a very long run.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_109.wav|It was just another race, and yesterday is history.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_110.wav|He later paid a tribute to his opponent.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_111.wav|Football is very easy, you have to work for the team.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_112.wav|It doesn't make them evil.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_113.wav|I have played really well all year.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_114.wav|We were a shambles at the back.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_115.wav|Parts of the system are already overstretched.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_116.wav|No passengers were on board.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_117.wav|It's like, If he's all right, we will go with him.|87,,
wav48/p323/p323_118.wav|If it does it means he has failed.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_119.wav|She added, It is the same story in both countries.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_120.wav|We have a high quality product.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_121.wav|A Scotsman has to defend his castle.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_122.wav|However, the move was bitterly criticised last night.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_123.wav|Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_124.wav|It will also take evidence from consumers.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_125.wav|I have been to see him.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_126.wav|I try not to expect anything.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_127.wav|I would never say anything against her.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_128.wav|He probably would not have added, mainly by me.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_129.wav|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_130.wav|I see no need for change.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_131.wav|We are in a very strong position.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_132.wav|This will have no effect on the championship.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_133.wav|We didn't turn it into the inspectors.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_134.wav|It was no more than they deserved.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_135.wav|Detectives are waiting to interview the men.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_136.wav|I'm just glad that no-one was hurt.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_137.wav|Everything was a dead end.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_138.wav|It's been a long, long journey.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_139.wav|I can give no comment.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_140.wav|Well, until recently he didn't think so.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_141.wav|What exactly is your job?|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_142.wav|They would love to do more films.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_143.wav|She is now planning a visit.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_144.wav|New blood is essential for progress.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_145.wav|It also calls for licensing of collection centres.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_146.wav|Boy is the town a mess.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_147.wav|Do yourselves a favour.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_148.wav|Substantial pockets of resistance remain.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_149.wav|I said, What does this mean?|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_150.wav|Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.|87,,
wav48/p323/p323_151.wav|We can do both.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_152.wav|What's it got to do with art?|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_153.wav|It is a very disturbing picture for men.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_154.wav|I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_155.wav|The encounter was to change his life.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_156.wav|They should not have behaved in that way.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_157.wav|I've never seen them down here.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_158.wav|The motive for the shooting was not known.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_159.wav|I got off to a great start.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_160.wav|It's the best of both worlds.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_161.wav|That is our unfinished business.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_162.wav|I don't know what we're doing wrong.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_163.wav|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_164.wav|But it was to no avail.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_165.wav|We tried everything, but it just wasn't to be today.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_166.wav|There are so many people to thank.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_167.wav|Nato has left them with no other option.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_168.wav|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_169.wav|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_170.wav|The stakes are high.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_171.wav|I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_172.wav|It was not a beautiful game, was it?|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_173.wav|That's just the way the game is evolving.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_174.wav|Michael is putting on a brave face.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_175.wav|We have done a deal with IMPACT.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_176.wav|O Leary was clearly disgusted.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_177.wav|What do they do, anyway?|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_178.wav|The next thing will be cutting journey times.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_179.wav|In the eyes of the supporters, there has been a betrayal.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_180.wav|They were later released, and last night were staying with relatives.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_181.wav|This is a mental challenge.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_182.wav|He was married with children.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_183.wav|They prefer the short, intensive session.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_184.wav|It would be difficult to argue with that.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_185.wav|He accused the Prime Minister of dithering.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_186.wav|The game is now open.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_187.wav|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_188.wav|Rather than just a way in, she begins with an entrance.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_189.wav|Nothing like this has ever happened here before.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_190.wav|It is time to come into the limelight.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_191.wav|However, within those figures, income from overseas visitors increased.|87,,
wav48/p323/p323_192.wav|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_193.wav|We have got to get it right.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_194.wav|You could see he was thinking about it.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_195.wav|Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_196.wav|We work for the athlete.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_197.wav|It was a good atmosphere.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_198.wav|It was published yesterday on the internet.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_199.wav|It was an accounting error.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_200.wav|The general secretary, represents a new era in Labour party politics.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_201.wav|It has never been worthwhile.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_202.wav|She is not in a coma.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_203.wav|There is no reason to put me out.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_204.wav|We begin, as ever, with a reminder of the end.|87,,
wav48/p323/p323_205.wav|So other options had to be explored.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_206.wav|But they were unable to respond in time, officials have said.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_207.wav|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_208.wav|Post offices are closing now.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_209.wav|I am pretty careful with money.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_210.wav|People love to see this stuff.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_211.wav|One film a year is, he says, his natural rhythm.|87,,
wav48/p323/p323_212.wav|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_213.wav|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_214.wav|His female companion was being treated for shock.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_215.wav|Is being naturally funny enough?|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_216.wav|Lack of pace is his big problem.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_217.wav|I have no plans to change the oath.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_218.wav|The process itself has taken over.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_219.wav|We had a huge response to that campaign.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_220.wav|We did not even get a free kick.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_221.wav|He was married with a young child.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_222.wav|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.|87,,
wav48/p323/p323_223.wav|I became a widow overnight.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_224.wav|We aren't going to play better.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_225.wav|That was the case with David.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_226.wav|They loved it and it showed.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_227.wav|But who cares?|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_228.wav|She became a heroine of my childhood.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_229.wav|That period was a struggle.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_230.wav|I am sure all schools would accept that.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_231.wav|I am an estate agent.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_232.wav|The conference will run from Wednesday until Sunday.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_233.wav|He is, indeed, the grandson of travelling folk.|87,,
wav48/p323/p323_234.wav|Is your life a little too easy?|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_235.wav|I think my game is suited to grass.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_236.wav|Anything can happen - at any moment.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_237.wav|He predicted the contest would be very close.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_238.wav|Who can say?|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_239.wav|My life would be a lot less restrictive.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_240.wav|The key issue for us is public safety.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_241.wav|Nobody wants to stop people enjoying themselves.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_242.wav|I went home and wrote about it.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_243.wav|The result could be all down to turnout.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_244.wav|Industry leaders reacted angrily.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_245.wav|There were no violations.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_246.wav|It appears to have been closed down.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_247.wav|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_248.wav|These are exciting times for young Scottish players.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_249.wav|People want to see me on the screen.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_250.wav|So far he has not done so.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_251.wav|Maybe they will show it next year.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_252.wav|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_253.wav|And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_254.wav|Everything is up for grabs.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_255.wav|Thankfully, for me, the matter is now closed.|87,,
wav48/p323/p323_256.wav|We are a new department.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_257.wav|Are we here?|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_258.wav|The conversion didn't go over either.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_259.wav|He said to me, Which one, son?|87,,
wav48/p323/p323_260.wav|There is nothing sinister in it.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_261.wav|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_262.wav|I've got to provide for my family.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_263.wav|It is having a big impact.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_264.wav|That is very hard, alone.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_265.wav|It's a very high number.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_266.wav|I was not happy about being left out.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_267.wav|Such debate is pointless.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_268.wav|It is a very beautiful city.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_269.wav|The same goes for Russia.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_270.wav|What do you think of the hair?|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_271.wav|It is not great art.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_272.wav|You do not change overnight.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_273.wav|We have to break that cycle.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_274.wav|The way they play, it is hard to score against them.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_275.wav|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_276.wav|Scotland had great assets.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_277.wav|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.|87,,
wav48/p323/p323_278.wav|Meantime, his appointment has been widely welcomed.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_279.wav|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.|87,,
wav48/p323/p323_280.wav|Have a look at our accounts.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_281.wav|We all like to see forgiveness and redemption.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_282.wav|It all changes for her.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_283.wav|We aim to put them out of business.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_284.wav|Is it a threat to union?|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_285.wav|We also have to work the dark side, if you will.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_286.wav|We remain confident that Danny is still alive.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_287.wav|Tony Blair should get out more.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_288.wav|We need to increase the membership.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_289.wav|Certainly, there is much on the agenda.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_290.wav|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_291.wav|He was just awesome.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_292.wav|No decision has yet been made.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_293.wav|Maybe his time has gone.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_294.wav|She died in hospital two hours later.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_295.wav|She was making a living, but her career was going nowhere.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_296.wav|I have never seen anything like it.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_297.wav|I've got the shirt.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_298.wav|Both were later released after a check-up.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_299.wav|We were a little bit nervous.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_300.wav|And she doesn't feel like Annika is better.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_301.wav|However, many questions remained unanswered.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_302.wav|I first met him last summer.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_303.wav|Detection is often difficult.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_304.wav|How good is Lennox Lewis?|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_305.wav|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_306.wav|I would ask the fans to be patient.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_307.wav|The plot is changing as time goes on.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_308.wav|We have other options.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_309.wav|I don't want to hear any excuses.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_310.wav|The son has autism and other problems.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_311.wav|This makes up for it.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_312.wav|I'm very puzzled by it.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_313.wav|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_314.wav|Volvo is grateful to its staff in Irvine.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_315.wav|All things are possible if you believe.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_316.wav|The council's concern is very simple.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_317.wav|This was not just incongruous.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_318.wav|This rule is archaic.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_319.wav|Rangers didn't turn up, by the way.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_320.wav|It was a virus.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_321.wav|My mother was getting on at me.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_322.wav|But it wasn't to be.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_323.wav|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_324.wav|She is an expert on medical ethics.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_325.wav|Then there is the terrain.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_326.wav|We will deal with the refugees.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_327.wav|It's such a shock.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_328.wav|The pair are no strangers to smashing records.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_329.wav|I didn't know there was anything wrong.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_330.wav|It was very well received.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_331.wav|If you could find it.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_332.wav|Such is the ego involved.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_333.wav|She was totally possessed.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_334.wav|It was not known to myself.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_335.wav|He is wanted by German police for questioning.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_336.wav|It is a vicious circle.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_337.wav|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_338.wav|We work on the same level.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_339.wav|Angola was a really hard place.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_340.wav|It is a love affair.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_341.wav|I was loving that little girl.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_342.wav|Everyone thought they were safe.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_343.wav|People wouldn't have quite understood the language.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_344.wav|We don't just play golf in Scotland.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_345.wav|That's why the young musicians have joined.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_346.wav|If they have City backing, what is the influence?|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_347.wav|Before the game we went for a pint.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_348.wav|The auction will be held tomorrow.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_349.wav|There is no credible official announcement.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_350.wav|However, pensions and salaries have yet to be settled.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_351.wav|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_352.wav|I'm trying to stay open on that.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_353.wav|At the same time it is a satire.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_354.wav|He died at the hands of his captors.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_355.wav|Talks will then resume again in the autumn.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_356.wav|I understand the medical concerns.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_357.wav|Yet the survey has been cautious.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_358.wav|This is a United Kingdom.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_359.wav|I thought it was a fantastic game.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_360.wav|This is a critical time for football.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_361.wav|Last year, it was ligaments in his knee.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_362.wav|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_363.wav|I think she is supreme.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_364.wav|However, who could have predicted this result?|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_365.wav|Shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_366.wav|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_367.wav|But we're not the same person.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_368.wav|There are simply no orders.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_369.wav|They were behind the wheel.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_370.wav|The pressure on the aid agencies is immense.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_371.wav|The problem arises because he does so much.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_372.wav|This is totally out of character for Stuart.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_373.wav|PR will be just one of them.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_374.wav|The answer is mayhem.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_375.wav|But the fans deserve to know!|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_376.wav|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.|87,,
wav48/p323/p323_377.wav|He asked how they were doing.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_378.wav|We have been extremely lucky this time.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_379.wav|I'll have to work on that.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_380.wav|He must be seen to be impartial.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_381.wav|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_382.wav|That will be the sweetness.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_383.wav|The law will take its course.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_384.wav|The idea has potential for the future.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_385.wav|But is it ethical to practice in humans?|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_386.wav|I don't have any more contact with Airdrie.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_387.wav|There was a fossil on screen.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_388.wav|I always loved the lightning in the movies.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_389.wav|I did not concentrate on my performance.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_390.wav|There is great interest on our island.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_391.wav|Later they changed their minds.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_392.wav|This does not create any precedent.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_393.wav|Hours later, she was found dead by Ms Wilson.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_394.wav|I want to go home.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_395.wav|He already had had complaints.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_396.wav|That, however, was only the tip of the iceberg.|87,,
wav48/p323/p323_397.wav|Of course he does!|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_398.wav|I'm just asking them to improve their disciplines.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_399.wav|The racist abuse was terrible.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_400.wav|The Farmer is called an idiot.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_401.wav|Five officers were injured.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_402.wav|You can say he gets a sizeable amount.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_403.wav|We didn't make any of this up.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_404.wav|Ms Jackson was not at the meeting.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_405.wav|The house was full of smoke.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_406.wav|A decision about that will be made today.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_407.wav|The early evidence suggests he did not.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_408.wav|It is too pretty, it is too small.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_409.wav|Ferguson had a most productive afternoon.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_410.wav|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_411.wav|We are seeking funds from government departments.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_412.wav|Last night, the row continued.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_413.wav|That, though, was again according to manager McCall.|87,,
wav48/p323/p323_414.wav|Now it's all written down.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_415.wav|The Dutchman was suspended for two games.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_416.wav|There is a spring in the step.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_417.wav|It's been a humbling year.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_418.wav|We tend to come good at the end.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_419.wav|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_420.wav|The commission is not the only loser.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_421.wav|As often as not, the cause remains a mystery.|87,,,
wav48/p323/p323_422.wav|I wish it well.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_423.wav|Harold is a rarity.|87,,,,
wav48/p323/p323_424.wav|I want him to take on Gomez.|87,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_001.wav|Please call Stella.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|88,,
wav48/p326/p326_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|88,,
wav48/p326/p326_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|88,,
wav48/p326/p326_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_019.wav|Since then physicists have found it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|88,,
wav48/p326/p326_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|88,,
wav48/p326/p326_025.wav|Jimmy returned to Aberdeen, but she remained with George.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_026.wav|The message was clear.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_027.wav|She is an angel.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_028.wav|It is believed he had been stabbed.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_029.wav|We have got to attack.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_030.wav|I saw the other car coming, but could do nothing.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_031.wav|United were in control without always being dominant.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_032.wav|There we were on the first tee.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_033.wav|Roy Keane is certainly the best.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_034.wav|At least two women were among those arrested.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_035.wav|How would it work?|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_036.wav|It was my shortest audition.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_037.wav|That was a stunning drive from Jon.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_038.wav|She didn't tell us anything new.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_039.wav|There is nothing like this back home.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_040.wav|The police believe the man was not injured.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_041.wav|It would be a miracle.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_042.wav|We just love to chat.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_043.wav|I read about it in the newspapers.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_044.wav|What did they think of her voice?|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_045.wav|They say they feel different.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_046.wav|It is a good result for Great Britain.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_047.wav|What on earth is wrong with you?|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_048.wav|We will continue to pressure the Government.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_049.wav|His art was not just about emotions.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_050.wav|They are all bright and different.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_051.wav|I found a fault and worked at it.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_052.wav|My position on the euro is quite clear.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_053.wav|Labour was too busy to respond.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_054.wav|His voice is strong.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_055.wav|They may yet have the last laugh.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_056.wav|But they add up.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_057.wav|You can feel at home in China.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_058.wav|It is the wealthiest in Europe.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_059.wav|This is all part of opening the door.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_060.wav|Yesterday's performance was exactly that.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_061.wav|Mr Blunkett was convinced.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_062.wav|For the other parties, it is back to business as usual.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_063.wav|He will become the sovereign.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_064.wav|It was a foolhardy decision.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_065.wav|Washington is consumed by the crisis.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_066.wav|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.|88,,
wav48/p326/p326_067.wav|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_068.wav|Everyone could see it apart from Kevin Keegan.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_069.wav|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.|88,,
wav48/p326/p326_070.wav|Messages have to be reinforced.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_071.wav|The success story shows no signs of stopping.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_072.wav|Another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_073.wav|The Insider opens tomorrow.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_074.wav|More patience and composure was required.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_075.wav|It is difficult when you don't know anyone.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_076.wav|I was shocked and outraged.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_077.wav|It's just gotten too big.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_078.wav|We're still in talks and, hopefully, they will continue.|88,,
wav48/p326/p326_079.wav|I am immensely proud of them.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_080.wav|It was extremely cold.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_081.wav|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_082.wav|No, we had nothing to do with the Jews.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_083.wav|There will be tough opponents to this report.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_084.wav|They were two different types.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_085.wav|Chelsea was a great club.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_086.wav|I can't believe it.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_087.wav|I couldn't believe it, but it looks like it's true.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_088.wav|We have them in offices all over.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_089.wav|It need not be like that.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_090.wav|There has been a sense of frustration.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_091.wav|At that time, there was no infection within five miles.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_092.wav|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_093.wav|This time, there were no such rewards.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_094.wav|That'd be good for the whole city.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_095.wav|It is, honestly, difficult to write about this.|88,,
wav48/p326/p326_096.wav|We are very very proud of Alain.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_097.wav|Around the building, the atmosphere is brittle and hung over.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_098.wav|It was exactly four months away.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_099.wav|The performance, for this listener, didn't come off.|88,,
wav48/p326/p326_100.wav|It was set in a cafe.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_101.wav|It certainly gives you hope.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_102.wav|If he does not leave, he will be shot.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_103.wav|Brown is an interesting man, but he's not desperate.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_104.wav|We've all been there at some point.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_105.wav|I'm totally horrified by the sentence.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_106.wav|Our people should be immune.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_107.wav|It's a metaphor for consumption.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_108.wav|I just saw them for a few minutes.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_109.wav|A management agreement, however, was conceded.|88,,
wav48/p326/p326_110.wav|It left me with a sadness.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_111.wav|Hopefully they will turn out tonight.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_112.wav|The boys are very confident.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_113.wav|The site has been fully recorded and surveyed.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_114.wav|Thousands of others have not been so fortunate.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_115.wav|Our objective is to tackle poverty.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_116.wav|What she will do next?|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_117.wav|Hopefully, everything is for the best.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_118.wav|Two things will count for us in Brussels.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_119.wav|She has now been registered as disabled.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_120.wav|Today's meeting was open and friendly.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_121.wav|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_122.wav|It is the stop-gap before extinction.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_123.wav|That is a data management problem.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_124.wav|Nor is he allowed out without permission.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_125.wav|He looked very sharp.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_126.wav|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_127.wav|I've beaten her a few times.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_128.wav|His father and mother are in film production.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_129.wav|This is not a long-term commitment.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_130.wav|It's about attitudes to change.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_131.wav|They failed in their duty to Mr Logan.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_132.wav|Yet she is one of the lucky ones.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_133.wav|Off-duty nurses were called in at Ayr.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_134.wav|That means no more taxation by stealth.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_135.wav|History may repeat itself with Billy Elliot.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_136.wav|Mr Campbell received a phone call.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_137.wav|People tended to stay there for some time.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_138.wav|Holland won by five wickets.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_139.wav|His expulsion would not solve the problem.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_140.wav|After day one back, he may be revising that opinion already.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_141.wav|We are not going to forget.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_142.wav|I'm the one that said it.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_143.wav|It's not hard to get involved.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_144.wav|I've grown up a bit.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_145.wav|For a moment it was all about her.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_146.wav|It changed my life.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_147.wav|Once they go away they won't come back.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_148.wav|It's a difficult one to comment on.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_149.wav|Our position is clear.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_150.wav|Yet it does not lose appeal.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_151.wav|But what will we put on it?|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_152.wav|Then in came a succession of signings.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_153.wav|It will benefit a lot of people.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_154.wav|A new school will be built.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_155.wav|The main thing is that they enjoy it.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_156.wav|It is worse because she suffers from angina.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_157.wav|I felt he was excellent.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_158.wav|It's not just a male agenda.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_159.wav|This meeting is the path to salvation.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_160.wav|I think we believed the tie was won.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_161.wav|She wanted to move.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_162.wav|How do you find the youngsters?|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_163.wav|It's always a rehearsal.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_164.wav|But it's a subtle process.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_165.wav|We all have to look in the mirror.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_166.wav|There is no internal damage.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_167.wav|About the bad things that happened to me.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_168.wav|She is a very lucky young lady.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_169.wav|It was a great team effort.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_170.wav|The threat to rural areas is real.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_171.wav|Tourism continues to struggle.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_172.wav|That, however, can only be achieved by constant investment.|88,,
wav48/p326/p326_173.wav|Its first awards will do just that.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_174.wav|We are already under pressure.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_175.wav|She didn't tell me anything the night before.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_176.wav|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_177.wav|The Scottish management team will settle for that.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_178.wav|THE US is a diverse and colourful nation.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_179.wav|He didn't have long to wait.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_180.wav|That was merely their initial problem.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_181.wav|I'm going to help out in the summer, as producer.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_182.wav|It would be really interesting if they did.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_183.wav|I need them to set my career.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_184.wav|I love the Scottish and the Irish people.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_185.wav|They don't know each other, but they have made this commitment.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_186.wav|He was all blackened.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_187.wav|This is your country.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_188.wav|I want to be there by right.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_189.wav|The fund has three elements.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_190.wav|You've just got to move on.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_191.wav|I feel really good.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_192.wav|So You Think You Want to be Victoria?|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_193.wav|This is still a young team, you know.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_194.wav|It's just the workings of the Scottish media.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_195.wav|The British government said she was coming home.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_196.wav|It's not even finished.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_197.wav|That is a matter for Mr Graham.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_198.wav|These people just lost their child.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_199.wav|Everyone knew where they were.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_200.wav|It may now be too expensive for anyone.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_201.wav|It was worth a photograph.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_202.wav|The processing plant was closed yesterday.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_203.wav|For the moment, our position remains the same.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_204.wav|Was this a new event?|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_205.wav|As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminster Hall.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_206.wav|In the old days, it was easy.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_207.wav|I came into this world with nothing.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_208.wav|We're still hopeful of concluding the deal.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_209.wav|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.|88,,
wav48/p326/p326_210.wav|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_211.wav|Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_212.wav|His style is suited to Scottish football.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_213.wav|After that he became more romantic.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_214.wav|It's not long enough.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_215.wav|My view has now completely changed.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_216.wav|You're going to take away my life.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_217.wav|He scored a touchdown.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_218.wav|They finished second and third.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_219.wav|We're playing away from home and that's it.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_220.wav|He was then replaced by Ross.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_221.wav|It had not been a terribly inspiring end, either.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_222.wav|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_223.wav|She did not attend the courtroom.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_224.wav|People can get them if they want.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_225.wav|Smith confirmed that their confidence was returning.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_226.wav|He is a law unto himself.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_227.wav|I was very, very happy.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_228.wav|No-one should see that.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_229.wav|We are going to go about our lives.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_230.wav|What is the point of jailing him?|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_231.wav|They made it very difficult for us.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_232.wav|Well, there is a bed.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_233.wav|You write a play.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_234.wav|There are no easy solutions to this problem.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_235.wav|The Government faces a moral dilemma.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_236.wav|Seems a sensible compromise.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_237.wav|This kind of traffic is commonplace.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_238.wav|I'm happy with the outcome.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_239.wav|An aide was instructed to get a copy.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_240.wav|The Allies intend to maintain the average.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_241.wav|Agents and coaches must be paid.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_242.wav|The vacancies are in support services and arts.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_243.wav|It is just completely erased.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_244.wav|His sister added, We expected him to be jailed.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_245.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_246.wav|I've been thinking about it for a year.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_247.wav|Scotland were on Saturday.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_248.wav|I enjoy playing with both of them.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_249.wav|Too often it is not.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_250.wav|Alex Ferguson is the same.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_251.wav|I tend not to look back.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_252.wav|Confidence among the allies began to slip.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_253.wav|The real problem is the Usher Hall.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_254.wav|My family, health and golf is always a balancing act.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_255.wav|I got a yellow card.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_256.wav|My game just seems to keep on improving.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_257.wav|We would expect it to disappear in time.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_258.wav|Technically, it was a very good performance by Scotland.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_259.wav|I'd love to have been on the pitch.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_260.wav|I never had any confidence in it afterwards.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_261.wav|I didn't know what he was capable of.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_262.wav|Our place as artists is to ask questions.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_263.wav|I ran to get out of the way.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_264.wav|She's now on the back benches.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_265.wav|But there are some problems.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_266.wav|It may also be her last.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_267.wav|It should not lose out in any way.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_268.wav|We're very pleased about the verdict.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_269.wav|It will not be a long campaign.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_270.wav|Subs not used, McGraw.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_271.wav|Maybe it helps us.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_272.wav|Three bystanders were killed.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_273.wav|We should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_274.wav|However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_275.wav|Was it just negligent.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_276.wav|He made no big mistakes.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_277.wav|It will not be today, though.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_278.wav|Which is a shame.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_279.wav|That is where our future lies.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_280.wav|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_281.wav|Mr Burrell was arrested almost a year ago.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_282.wav|That was enough for the committee.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_283.wav|We will be homeless.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_284.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_285.wav|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_286.wav|Sure, this is a very important event for me.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_287.wav|We have to focus on what is important.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_288.wav|They have to work so hard.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_289.wav|But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_290.wav|Well, was it?|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_291.wav|That's my big challenge.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_292.wav|The problems are a result of that shortfall.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_293.wav|We have to adapt to this level.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_294.wav|So what is it with Nato?|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_295.wav|We won't let you down.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_296.wav|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_297.wav|There's a strong involvement.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_298.wav|The observer saw no evidence ofr fighting.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_299.wav|He was visited by UK consular officials.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_300.wav|So we shall remain vigilant, and keep the pressure on him.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_301.wav|English is the language of pop music.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_302.wav|The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_303.wav|It is a simple equation.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_304.wav|It makes a huge difference.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_305.wav|By that time, however, it was already too late.|88,,
wav48/p326/p326_306.wav|She has seen, or heard, it all.|88,,
wav48/p326/p326_307.wav|Which Scot is likely to emulate his achievements?|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_308.wav|Could you put it in writing?|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_309.wav|They play together perfectly.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_310.wav|We will meet again.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_311.wav|It's a record label, not a form of music.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_312.wav|The other conditions were not specified.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_313.wav|They should use it on the catwalk.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_314.wav|Perhaps it is the Crown Estate.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_315.wav|We're looking at the Citizens Theatre the Lyceum.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_316.wav|It certainly sounded it at times.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_317.wav|Anyone can take a photo.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_318.wav|We were very happy with our results, which were excellent.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_319.wav|They treated me with respect and courtesy.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_320.wav|He is involved in everything.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_321.wav|Family, if you like.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_322.wav|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_323.wav|I don't want to change anything.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_324.wav|I've only met him three times.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_325.wav|You see, my back has gone.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_326.wav|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_327.wav|Part of Johnny was found some days after.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_328.wav|We are the weakest link.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_329.wav|It had been on the cards.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_330.wav|She looked very, very poor.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_331.wav|He did, and he missed.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_332.wav|Nato has completed planning for air strikes.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_333.wav|Many innocent people will die.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_334.wav|The mood was defiant.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_335.wav|We have now no choice.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_336.wav|I'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_337.wav|Butcher has only one idea in mind.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_338.wav|It's our worst nightmare.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_339.wav|We gave them the goal.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_340.wav|Self control is just one instalment.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_341.wav|It would be a massive boost for them.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_342.wav|You never had it so good.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_343.wav|Both are national treasures.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_344.wav|The then secretary was not amused.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_345.wav|I can't speak for him.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_346.wav|It is also claimed that he was murdered.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_347.wav|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_348.wav|I can't see him reversing that.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_349.wav|He was on a horse.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_350.wav|I'm really looking forward to it.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_351.wav|Capital gains tax is also being reduced.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_352.wav|I think, at last, the company will find itself again.|88,,
wav48/p326/p326_353.wav|And that gives a kind of freedom.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_354.wav|I have also been delighted with Stevie.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_355.wav|He's on the wrong side.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_356.wav|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_357.wav|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_358.wav|Labour is providing none of these.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_359.wav|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.|88,,
wav48/p326/p326_360.wav|There is no musical background in his family.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_361.wav|However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_362.wav|The mix with Tiger is perfect.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_363.wav|There were no immediate reports of injuries.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_364.wav|Well, it happened to me, so it's happening to him.|88,,
wav48/p326/p326_366.wav|Finally action had been taken.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_367.wav|We're not travel agents.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_368.wav|It's hard not to.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_369.wav|Broke down and can't be fixed.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_370.wav|I'm desperate to play in this match.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_371.wav|That's always the case, isn't it?|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_372.wav|However, there are no plans for injecting rooms.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_373.wav|Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_374.wav|It is patently true.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_375.wav|They did not threaten anyone.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_376.wav|There is no hiding place in it, no room for passengers.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_377.wav|That is the position the MoD has adopted.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_378.wav|But sometimes it works out all right.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_379.wav|What are you supposed to do, just walk away?|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_380.wav|Even then he was in the media spotlight.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_381.wav|Therein lies the problem.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_382.wav|You feel the pride.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_383.wav|But this is not just a Tibetan issue.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_384.wav|The distinction is also supported by doctors.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_385.wav|I have to keep working hard.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_386.wav|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_387.wav|Art is still a risky investment.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_388.wav|That is difficult to answer.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_389.wav|A century on, little has changed.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_390.wav|Wrong decisions Address in full|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_391.wav|My father had been unwell for many years.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_392.wav|She said she would not welcome the flowers.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_393.wav|It is a temptation which should be resisted.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_394.wav|However, his remarks were heavily qualified.|88,,,
wav48/p326/p326_395.wav|It was like the old days.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_396.wav|A great deal has been achieved.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_397.wav|My future is in the marathon.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_398.wav|Then he did it twice.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_399.wav|So is the rest of British sport.|88,,,,
wav48/p326/p326_400.wav|It had until tomorrow to comply.|88,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_001.wav|Please call Stella.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|89,,
wav48/p329/p329_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|89,,
wav48/p329/p329_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|89,,
wav48/p329/p329_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|89,,
wav48/p329/p329_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|89,,
wav48/p329/p329_025.wav|But there has never been the time, she said.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_026.wav|This could be one such case, he declared.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_027.wav|It's not a solo.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_028.wav|The investment programme will deliver these improvements.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_029.wav|I fell in love with ballet.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_030.wav|That their music is truly, truly, truly great.|89,,
wav48/p329/p329_031.wav|I had found my vision.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_032.wav|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_033.wav|But they were unable to respond in time, officials have said.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_034.wav|We don't know the scale of need.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_035.wav|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.|89,,
wav48/p329/p329_036.wav|We had a huge response to that campaign.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_037.wav|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.|89,,
wav48/p329/p329_038.wav|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_039.wav|We're still talking with a few people.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_040.wav|We know you will not let us down.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_041.wav|He will never walk the streets again.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_042.wav|There are big names.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_043.wav|That argument has been won.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_044.wav|Normally, they have been a pack of lies.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_045.wav|I hope you will leave it at that.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_046.wav|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_047.wav|The bill would be massive.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_048.wav|He was just a journalist.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_049.wav|They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_050.wav|Thames Valley police decided not to prosecute.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_051.wav|I didn't have a clue.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_052.wav|How can they engage with the work?|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_053.wav|I have been coming here for nine years.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_054.wav|She has a wonderful mind.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_055.wav|There are just two tournaments remaining.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_056.wav|We're into that build-up now.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_057.wav|It is the end of an era.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_058.wav|I have had no social life at all.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_059.wav|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_060.wav|In short, the club was broke.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_061.wav|His charisma is all on the course.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_062.wav|I am still pretty young in this business.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_063.wav|On Saturday, it was much the same.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_064.wav|We're not the tourist board.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_065.wav|It was the same old story.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_066.wav|Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_067.wav|The Commons is too outdated.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_068.wav|You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_069.wav|What happens when the funding is exhausted.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_070.wav|It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_071.wav|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_072.wav|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.|89,,
wav48/p329/p329_073.wav|He would be with his peers.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_074.wav|They seem to be backing off from that.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_075.wav|This will be no easy option.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_076.wav|I wish they, too, would get a grip.|89,,
wav48/p329/p329_077.wav|I am so sorry.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_078.wav|This avalanche is just beginning.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_079.wav|It is a pity, but you can't have everything.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_080.wav|We will see how he is after treatment.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_081.wav|I was there for five hours.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_082.wav|But then he changed his mind.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_083.wav|I don't know why she is not here.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_084.wav|They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_085.wav|There are no excuses.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_086.wav|I feel very strongly about that.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_087.wav|It is a difficult thing to explain.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_088.wav|He just wants to play.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_089.wav|It's very difficult and very worrying.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_090.wav|Slater was fortunate to be wearing a helmet.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_091.wav|I cannot speak on behalf of the IRA.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_092.wav|His treatment has been quite atrocious.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_093.wav|I want to play at the highest level.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_094.wav|Nothing like this has ever happened here before.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_095.wav|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_096.wav|Jamming would be equally difficult.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_097.wav|Drugs are always an issue.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_098.wav|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_099.wav|This kind of problem arises everywhere.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_100.wav|There are lots of these women in Finland.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_101.wav|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_102.wav|There is no guarantee.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_103.wav|We make good weapons.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_104.wav|I'm confident we can turn things around.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_105.wav|He lost his job, but it was not just a job.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_106.wav|The news was yesterday welcomed by union leaders.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_107.wav|Scottish rugby has given me everything.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_108.wav|It may be argued.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_109.wav|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_110.wav|I bought a car at auction.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_111.wav|They agree to meet.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_112.wav|They could not hear.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_113.wav|It has been hijacked.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_114.wav|His three-year appointment begins on Monday.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_115.wav|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_116.wav|She had been sexually assaulted.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_117.wav|The event has now gone to Helsinki.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_118.wav|That is different from being impartial.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_119.wav|Both offices were closed yesterday.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_120.wav|They don't have to, but they normally do.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_121.wav|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.|89,,
wav48/p329/p329_122.wav|David was not either.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_123.wav|They are so easy for youngsters to open.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_124.wav|He wanted someone young and ambitious.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_125.wav|More patience and composure was required.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_126.wav|That's why the young musicians have joined.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_127.wav|There is no smoking gun.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_128.wav|The trial is set for February.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_129.wav|I didn't play well last year.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_130.wav|It was an ambush.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_131.wav|Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_132.wav|Mr Blair was in Washington a week later.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_133.wav|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_134.wav|Is that too much to ask?|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_135.wav|I have so much respect for him.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_136.wav|Each one has its own system.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_137.wav|I felt under no pressure today.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_138.wav|The Devil is the creator of weapons.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_139.wav|And that was the adults.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_140.wav|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.|89,,
wav48/p329/p329_141.wav|That is a job for the Government.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_142.wav|And he had much need.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_143.wav|Last night the bombardment was terrible.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_144.wav|The other children were severely mentally impaired.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_145.wav|This can only help us go forward.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_146.wav|That left a bad taste in my mouth.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_147.wav|But, even so, you always want to try something new.|89,,
wav48/p329/p329_148.wav|Jonny Wilkinson had an off-day on Saturday.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_149.wav|I hadn't been looking after myself.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_150.wav|And really, the songs are the key thing.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_151.wav|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_152.wav|Perhaps they knew something we didn't.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_153.wav|Northern Ireland is a society divided by religion.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_154.wav|The whole experience has left me bitter.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_155.wav|I guess it is down to focus.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_156.wav|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_157.wav|I have great respect for all my players.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_158.wav|His track record is not promising.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_159.wav|No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.|89,,
wav48/p329/p329_160.wav|For a moment it was all about her.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_161.wav|It will be a great night.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_162.wav|Sadly, the game will never see his like again.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_163.wav|Trading Places was too obvious.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_164.wav|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?|89,,
wav48/p329/p329_165.wav|That's the way it is.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_166.wav|We've been calling for a level playing field.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_167.wav|I see the extended family once a year.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_168.wav|I am not a magician.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_169.wav|We couldn't go very fast.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_170.wav|There was even a joke.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_171.wav|Tony Blair, can you see her face?|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_172.wav|You probably have never seen them before.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_173.wav|They had previously been on five-day notice.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_174.wav|She had experience of the wildest places.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_175.wav|It is highly unlikely.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_176.wav|The show is small but perfectly formed.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_177.wav|That is the first job of the director - leadership.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_178.wav|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.|89,,
wav48/p329/p329_179.wav|It is too early to speculate.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_180.wav|I love the moment of being first.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_181.wav|Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_182.wav|Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_183.wav|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.|89,,
wav48/p329/p329_184.wav|Or so we have long assumed.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_185.wav|They responded with victories.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_186.wav|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.|89,,
wav48/p329/p329_187.wav|What is the truth about the cow?|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_188.wav|They will want to watch a winning team.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_189.wav|I think it's awful.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_190.wav|Who is going to be penalised?|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_191.wav|This will be just another tax on motorists.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_192.wav|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_193.wav|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_194.wav|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.|89,,
wav48/p329/p329_195.wav|It is a scandal.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_196.wav|Nor should there have been.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_197.wav|Just see where the blood is coming from.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_198.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_199.wav|I have a theory.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_200.wav|But these were the nights.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_201.wav|In her opinion, the rich are different.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_202.wav|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_203.wav|I am aware that somebody made a threat.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_204.wav|He was jailed for five years.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_205.wav|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_206.wav|We will not break even.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_207.wav|We will look into it.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_208.wav|Sentence was deferred for background reports.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_209.wav|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_210.wav|What did they think of her voice?|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_211.wav|But he's not afraid to take risks.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_212.wav|Three years probation is just a joke.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_213.wav|We did not talk about it.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_214.wav|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_215.wav|The court has not decided.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_216.wav|We are opening an inquiry.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_217.wav|I get to work with very good people.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_218.wav|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_219.wav|We find this very sad.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_220.wav|Four people died instantly.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_221.wav|But it obviously doesn't, so the government needs to intervene.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_222.wav|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_223.wav|I'm really happy with the way it went.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_224.wav|It is a step on the way.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_225.wav|Her husband had been waiting for her return.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_226.wav|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_227.wav|People tended to stay there for some time.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_228.wav|All businesses continue to trade.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_229.wav|It's a difficult job.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_230.wav|Several hundred people attended yesterday.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_231.wav|My preference is for the single vaccines.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_232.wav|This represents a tough game for us.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_233.wav|The boy is no longer with us.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_234.wav|I can't wait for the outdoors.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_235.wav|This is my new career.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_236.wav|It really was a masterful innings.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_237.wav|Mary Archer is almost too clever.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_238.wav|I would urge the Government to think again.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_239.wav|It will be even more difficult tomorrow.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_240.wav|They were on holiday in Egypt.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_241.wav|I was happiest with my short game.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_242.wav|I leave tonight for England.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_243.wav|There is no change in our position.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_244.wav|Everything else is a bonus.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_245.wav|We went on to become very successful.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_246.wav|I'm delighted with how he has come through.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_247.wav|We must learn from the past.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_248.wav|We certainly did enough to win it, but didn't.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_249.wav|We told them in August.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_250.wav|That could be at least five years away.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_251.wav|That is my role.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_252.wav|I have no comment to make.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_253.wav|The sense of excitement in Stirling is tangible.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_254.wav|He also presented You Bet!|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_255.wav|I just went a bit too far.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_256.wav|And how he kept his word.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_257.wav|This is a wonderful honour for me.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_258.wav|In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_259.wav|He was a crazy man.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_260.wav|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_261.wav|That kind of growth is the important thing.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_262.wav|I have no argument with Scotland.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_263.wav|And a film maker was born.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_264.wav|It was also put on the Internet.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_265.wav|The reason is the thought of Olympic gold.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_266.wav|I hope he stays.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_267.wav|He also has a Scottish grandfather.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_268.wav|Now that was a boxing movie.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_269.wav|Top-up fees are not on the agenda.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_270.wav|There was a battle there.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_271.wav|I might also completely change the routine.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_272.wav|Today's ruling confirms that fact.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_273.wav|It's good news and long overdue.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_274.wav|I'd never heard him in person before.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_275.wav|From a marketing standpoint, you can understand their concern.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_276.wav|I saw them not long after it happened.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_277.wav|He doesn't do dinner.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_278.wav|He has been campaigning for change for years.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_279.wav|That's a very strong element.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_280.wav|A formal decision will be announced within months.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_281.wav|I have beaten her a few times.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_282.wav|He was at home with his pals.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_283.wav|We are taking it seriously.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_284.wav|It was deployed in the Gulf War.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_285.wav|Maybe this battle has been.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_286.wav|The manager is there to make these decisions.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_287.wav|Now, she has completed a family tradition.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_288.wav|Then followed a bout of flu.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_289.wav|I have worked with him on projects.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_290.wav|We had no part in it.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_291.wav|His father and mother are in film production.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_292.wav|The methadone programme is completely out of control.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_293.wav|It was nice to get a clean sheet.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_294.wav|The referee had been right.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_295.wav|Our young people are leaving.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_296.wav|That would have been too easy.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_297.wav|She admitted the theft of letters and deception.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_298.wav|This is not a faceless system.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_299.wav|This is a long-term discussion paper.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_300.wav|In all cases computer equipment was seized.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_301.wav|That is just a load of baloney.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_302.wav|I'm feeling very pleased.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_303.wav|The damage from the fire was huge.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_304.wav|She had kept the news from him.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_305.wav|Both agreed on the success of the event.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_306.wav|But we'll just keep trying to get results.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_307.wav|A play is a set of actions.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_308.wav|Clearly, that is important in nursing.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_309.wav|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_310.wav|The campaign was raucous.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_311.wav|Seaman is not the goalkeeper of old.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_312.wav|But both were involved with other matters.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_313.wav|We were in different places, usually in cellars.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_314.wav|However, in October another partnership was announced.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_315.wav|There is no threat to them.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_316.wav|The time is up for Iraq to comply.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_317.wav|Nelson does not disappoint.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_318.wav|The woman is basically off her head.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_319.wav|The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_320.wav|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_321.wav|It is high time to act.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_322.wav|Then we will face the Danish champions.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_323.wav|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.|89,
wav48/p329/p329_324.wav|The South African defended his work ethic.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_325.wav|Pressure of work is no excuse.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_326.wav|There was barely a handful of chances.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_327.wav|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_328.wav|But when he left, the decision was forced upon us.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_329.wav|I can't believe something like this could happen.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_330.wav|Quite simply, for once in his life, he got it wrong.|89,,
wav48/p329/p329_331.wav|As often as not, the cause remains a mystery.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_332.wav|However, we have not come to any conclusions.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_333.wav|Overall, though, it has been a pretty good week.|89,,
wav48/p329/p329_334.wav|That is not the way we should operate.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_335.wav|The new work will begin in the autumn.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_336.wav|Here, again, they were denied a voice.|89,,
wav48/p329/p329_337.wav|We have nothing to hide.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_338.wav|It might have been a satanic ritual.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_339.wav|I'll take the blame for that.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_340.wav|It is now time for justice.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_341.wav|That is no use.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_342.wav|There is great interest on our island.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_343.wav|But he is frustrated at every turn.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_344.wav|Our house was very small.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_345.wav|Brian Wilson, in case you didn't know, is a genius.|89,,
wav48/p329/p329_346.wav|Later they changed their minds.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_347.wav|Clearly, it is time to meet this young man.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_348.wav|First is open defiance.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_349.wav|That is absolute nonsense.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_350.wav|I just had so much fun.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_351.wav|It was quite rigorous.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_352.wav|It is a decision which has paid off.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_353.wav|He denied that he was an absentee landlord.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_354.wav|Their mind was already made up.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_355.wav|I had some time with Aston Villa.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_356.wav|We do not expect any surplus.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_357.wav|You don't do the same thing with men.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_358.wav|Just don't go looking to be shocked.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_359.wav|Pray that it is so.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_360.wav|No, is the answer to your first question.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_361.wav|There was support from across the board.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_362.wav|There may be some evidence to this effect.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_363.wav|It is playing long, but it is also in beautiful condition.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_364.wav|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_365.wav|We have been preparing all year.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_366.wav|The position on the euro remains unchanged.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_367.wav|So what does one do?|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_368.wav|Such actions are rarely popular.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_369.wav|News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_370.wav|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_371.wav|I joined a group.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_372.wav|The Foreign Office was conspicuous by its absence.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_373.wav|They probably expected something special from me.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_374.wav|But we could not change his mind.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_375.wav|We have a team to reach the final.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_376.wav|However, there you have it, success has eluded them so far.|89,,
wav48/p329/p329_377.wav|The written judgment was issued in printed form.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_378.wav|I see no reason for them to be.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_379.wav|Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.|89,,
wav48/p329/p329_380.wav|I never agreed with that.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_381.wav|Have you heard anything from Paramount?|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_382.wav|He was dead on arrival at the hospital.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_383.wav|He added, however, that all options are under review.|89,,
wav48/p329/p329_384.wav|It is a dilemma.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_385.wav|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_386.wav|They keep the atmosphere in mind.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_387.wav|There is no dispute with the Iraqi people.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_388.wav|They did not interfere.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_389.wav|Which brings us to the Scottish connection.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_390.wav|It is a catalogue of obstruction.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_391.wav|I'm happy to contribute to that.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_392.wav|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_393.wav|My father died in childbirth.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_394.wav|As if he were a High Court judge.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_395.wav|And that started me thinking.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_396.wav|Offered the gold medal, he declined.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_397.wav|It brings together two essential elements.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_398.wav|The issue has still to be resolved.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_399.wav|He is a joy to watch.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_400.wav|We have high hopes that this will work.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_401.wav|We are now open.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_402.wav|People ask about the concept of a team.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_403.wav|Who has he fought?|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_404.wav|The film is about the cost of genius.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_405.wav|They've been here before.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_406.wav|I want a free vote.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_407.wav|He came close to signing for Rangers, too.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_408.wav|It would show them a positive way forward.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_409.wav|Players were held in equally low regard.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_410.wav|He also admitted possessing a firearm.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_411.wav|ALL IS busy but not much is happening.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_412.wav|Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_413.wav|They have the cash to do that.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_414.wav|He was not seeking special advantage.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_415.wav|There was a fine line to tread.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_416.wav|Yet it is all for two good causes.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_417.wav|It is so elusive and light.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_418.wav|Or was it Some kind of a ham?|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_419.wav|We've come from a long way back.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_420.wav|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.|89,,,
wav48/p329/p329_421.wav|I'll never think of myself as a star.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_422.wav|The country is in a state of chaos.|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_423.wav|What will happen if it all goes wrong?|89,,,,
wav48/p329/p329_424.wav|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.|89,,,
wav48/p330/p330_001.wav|Please call Stella.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|90,,
wav48/p330/p330_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|90,,
wav48/p330/p330_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|90,,
wav48/p330/p330_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|90,,
wav48/p330/p330_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|90,,
wav48/p330/p330_025.wav|Like anyone else, he has to take his time.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_026.wav|I was backing him up.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_027.wav|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_028.wav|Surely history will not repeat itself.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_029.wav|That was their attitude.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_030.wav|It was nothing to do with my daughter.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_031.wav|The problem in Norway is outside the National.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_032.wav|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_033.wav|And it had two seats.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_034.wav|They could move in at any moment.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_035.wav|There were no reported injuries.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_036.wav|I haven't spoken to anyone about that, not even my wife.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_037.wav|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_038.wav|It is my nature.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_039.wav|Or so she thought.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_040.wav|Thousands of homes were left without power supplies.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_041.wav|This advice was accepted by ministers.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_042.wav|We did not even get a free kick.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_043.wav|What was going through her mind that day, that night?|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_044.wav|Our decision making was poor.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_045.wav|Last night they were being comforted by relatives.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_046.wav|They said we were out of touch.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_047.wav|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_048.wav|It is bad news for the flooded areas.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_049.wav|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_050.wav|There will be widespread support on all sides.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_051.wav|This was the classical period of Beethoven.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_052.wav|He has one son and one daughter.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_053.wav|I was never going to play against Scotland.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_054.wav|Any error of judgment was ruled out.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_055.wav|Scotland had great assets.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_056.wav|We shall not forget him.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_057.wav|And thought we would get away with it.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_058.wav|I think they should have more respect.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_059.wav|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_060.wav|This is a big club.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_061.wav|I find it rather oppressive.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_062.wav|Many, many people don't know who he is.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_063.wav|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_064.wav|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.|90,,
wav48/p330/p330_065.wav|We have to expand.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_066.wav|Others may be trying to catch up.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_067.wav|We gave everything we had.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_068.wav|I think it is a release of tension.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_069.wav|This is a most serious matter.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_070.wav|I let go the telephone and ran.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_071.wav|It is also very valuable.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_072.wav|We're trying to lessen the stigma.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_073.wav|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.|90,,
wav48/p330/p330_074.wav|This makes up for it.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_075.wav|This is purely financial.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_076.wav|I want to help other women.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_077.wav|The problem is Labour.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_078.wav|The way ahead is not easy.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_079.wav|I could do a better job.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_080.wav|I will not be in dialogue with her.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_081.wav|An announcement will follow in due course.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_082.wav|I am here to play football.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_083.wav|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_084.wav|That is the crunch.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_085.wav|I did not want any damage to us.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_086.wav|Four minutes later, the show was over.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_087.wav|It was an easy decision to come here.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_088.wav|I didn't know the company all that well, or the dancers.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_089.wav|However, you have just got to adjust to it.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_090.wav|Everything has the potential to be serious.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_091.wav|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_092.wav|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_093.wav|This will be great for the young lads.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_094.wav|He needed seven hours of surgery.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_095.wav|Who said impatience is a virtue?|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_096.wav|What do we do for an encore?|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_097.wav|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.|90,,
wav48/p330/p330_098.wav|Many other Scottish locations also feature.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_099.wav|There's nothing for the kids.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_100.wav|Creative, expressive football was the order of the day.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_101.wav|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_102.wav|The feeling is marvellous.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_103.wav|An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_104.wav|It was more like a Labour Party rally.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_105.wav|The conductor, too, will have adjustments to make.|90,,
wav48/p330/p330_106.wav|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_107.wav|I'm astonished the men were not injured.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_108.wav|The partnership was set up during the summer.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_109.wav|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_110.wav|The money is not really our concern.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_111.wav|You just know it.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_112.wav|Wallace was in at the deep end.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_113.wav|Don't say you have not been warned.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_114.wav|Some were close to tears.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_115.wav|Seven children had lost both parents.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_116.wav|So, how will it be received in the US?|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_117.wav|The government was consulting interested parties, he added.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_118.wav|Above all, he was knocked out by the choir.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_119.wav|There will always be someone, somewhere, willing to undercut on price.|90,,
wav48/p330/p330_120.wav|Who, then, is going to be captain of Europe?|90,,
wav48/p330/p330_121.wav|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_122.wav|Some people still think she should be English.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_123.wav|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_124.wav|Repayment is not part of the game.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_125.wav|Who will perform?|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_126.wav|It's like a high school play.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_127.wav|He was part of South Africa.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_128.wav|It's much more dynamic.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_129.wav|The party will make up its own mind.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_130.wav|What do they pay to join the club?|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_131.wav|Two people are allowed to share the duty.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_132.wav|They want to avoid a flashpoint.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_133.wav|We are now in a safe place.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_134.wav|She goes to the opening of an envelope.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_135.wav|The reason, of course, was Iraq.|90,,
wav48/p330/p330_136.wav|It will be very useful for us.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_137.wav|He was obviously very genuine.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_138.wav|We told them in July.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_139.wav|It's like a garage.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_140.wav|He will be judged by his actions.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_141.wav|No Briton has ever won.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_142.wav|The answer is with ourselves.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_143.wav|That is the last thing they need.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_144.wav|Was society doing enough?|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_145.wav|The results are sometimes contentious.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_146.wav|I never thought it would take this long.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_147.wav|He changed my life.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_148.wav|There was nothing else to match it.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_149.wav|I was unconscious for two or three seconds.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_150.wav|It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.|90,,
wav48/p330/p330_151.wav|They have worked with each other.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_152.wav|O, Is there a lot of blood?|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_153.wav|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_154.wav|That will alter the dynamics of Scottish politics.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_155.wav|His parenthood is called into question.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_156.wav|Audacious decisions were taken early on.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_157.wav|But it could have been written for her.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_158.wav|His only reply was a laugh.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_159.wav|I'm really looking forward to it.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_160.wav|A report will be issued by March.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_161.wav|We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_162.wav|The party lasted all night.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_163.wav|I was delighted with every one of them.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_164.wav|Sure the COE is a cracking band.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_165.wav|At the time of watching, however, it is totally convincing.|90,,
wav48/p330/p330_166.wav|It was horrible, but there is still more.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_167.wav|I was proud of our lads.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_168.wav|So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_169.wav|This is not a Scottish problem.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_170.wav|It was his twenty-first birthday on Monday.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_171.wav|There were unconfirmed reports that it was cannabis.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_172.wav|After that, we made some changes.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_173.wav|These things are important for clubs like ourselves.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_174.wav|He didn't have time for any other hobbies.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_175.wav|Scotland were beaten again.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_176.wav|Glasgow is a tour de force.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_177.wav|I have no battle with the Scots.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_178.wav|The League of Nations was also his idea.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_179.wav|I've done it almost like a variety show.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_180.wav|He urged Mr Blair to get out more.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_181.wav|She is on a life support machine.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_182.wav|The actor has met with Mandela.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_183.wav|Euro The single currency is a fact.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_184.wav|This is a dream come true for me.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_185.wav|The election is total confusion and chaos.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_186.wav|I think it'll be a great occasion.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_187.wav|He went to see what he could learn.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_188.wav|It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_189.wav|A board of inquiry has already been convened.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_190.wav|We're not an employment agency.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_191.wav|It has all been positive.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_192.wav|Referees are easy targets.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_193.wav|It's not one or the other, you have to have both.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_194.wav|No government has that right.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_195.wav|The luxury has been well used.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_196.wav|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_197.wav|Billie was yet to be born.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_198.wav|She died in hospital two hours later.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_199.wav|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.|90,,
wav48/p330/p330_200.wav|This is a good result for them.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_201.wav|We think all other measures are not exhausted.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_202.wav|There was no time scale.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_203.wav|Our message was inclusive.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_204.wav|She was right about the struggle.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_205.wav|Only the scale of change differed.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_206.wav|That was one very hard game.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_207.wav|I think the euro has slipped.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_208.wav|We began to walk down.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_209.wav|I will not take you out of context.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_210.wav|Winning, meanwhile, is headed back to New York City.|90,,
wav48/p330/p330_211.wav|The cold war is over.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_212.wav|I'd like to take the plunge.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_213.wav|There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_214.wav|Lately, that market has come under pressure.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_215.wav|It had to be more flexible.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_216.wav|We are not far from a deal.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_217.wav|Are there muscular problems?|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_218.wav|You remember how long he lasted?|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_219.wav|Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_220.wav|Ordering online was very easy.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_221.wav|I didn't want to fall out with anyone.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_222.wav|However, Sharon rejected the claims.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_223.wav|I think it is a great idea.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_224.wav|After about a year, the feeling returned to my finger.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_225.wav|But it's just great to have won.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_226.wav|We're going to see more extreme weather.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_227.wav|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_228.wav|All these women were actors.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_229.wav|I've got no secret.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_230.wav|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_231.wav|Craig is still suffering seizures.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_232.wav|What happened to me last week was wrong.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_233.wav|I never made any offer to Mark.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_234.wav|To a level which we consider appropriate.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_235.wav|That is the first thing we need.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_236.wav|Will they ever reopen?|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_237.wav|After that date, the numbers should stabilise or fall.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_238.wav|We have great team spirit.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_239.wav|Above all the aggression must be stopped.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_240.wav|A national strike would be dangerous and damaging.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_241.wav|We have to concentrate on three points tomorrow.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_242.wav|You would fall over, he said.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_243.wav|We have a lot of sympathy for applicants.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_244.wav|They should take their mobile phones.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_245.wav|He loved his job and working in newspapers.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_246.wav|Mr Finnie, however, said his hands were tied.|90,,
wav48/p330/p330_247.wav|They are also exploited by the markets.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_248.wav|The principle is quite clear.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_249.wav|Talks will then resume again in the autumn.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_250.wav|The board of governors must act.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_251.wav|We must all play our part.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_252.wav|I first met him last summer.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_253.wav|It was to be published next month.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_254.wav|That is a break with tradition.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_255.wav|Otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_256.wav|It could have been a hammering by now.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_257.wav|Last night, the centre issued a statement to the contrary.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_258.wav|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_259.wav|Subs not used, Fernandez.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_260.wav|The question is, Is that a negative?|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_261.wav|This would discourage investment and job creation.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_262.wav|I played really well on the back nine.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_263.wav|Last week, he was taken into hospital.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_264.wav|He will decide tomorrow.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_265.wav|It was tough, but we did have a lot of possession.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_266.wav|Over the last four years, we have been fairly consistent.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_267.wav|That end is enjoying life, as far as David is concerned.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_268.wav|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.|90,,
wav48/p330/p330_269.wav|Mary is, as it were, the cause of her mother's death.|90,,
wav48/p330/p330_270.wav|That is our main aim.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_271.wav|For this government, reform and resources go together.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_272.wav|I always knew she was funny.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_273.wav|However, many of their victories have been close affairs.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_274.wav|All kinds of things occur.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_275.wav|Mentally, you have to be tough.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_276.wav|I expected these kind of questions.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_277.wav|The film has also been superbly designed.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_278.wav|It was fit for royalty.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_279.wav|It is always the same, isn't it?|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_280.wav|Who would take it now, after all this?|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_281.wav|I felt really good until Friday.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_282.wav|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.|90
wav48/p330/p330_283.wav|I am confident of the outcome this week.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_284.wav|Equity declined to comment.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_285.wav|There is precious little middle ground.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_286.wav|She was shouting my baby, my baby.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_287.wav|He later became a respected High Court judge.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_288.wav|They were both delightful to work with.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_289.wav|It's my delight on a shiny night.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_290.wav|If convicted, they face the death penalty.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_291.wav|It's now down in black and white.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_292.wav|Twaddle is a case in point.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_293.wav|Arsenal have plenty in the tank.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_294.wav|Just watch the videos and you'll see it.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_295.wav|There were no formal announcements.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_296.wav|For now, we must take one game at a time.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_297.wav|That was quite an interesting part.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_298.wav|Breaking new ground is also very rewarding.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_299.wav|Motion described it as a unique event.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_300.wav|We have to offer value for money.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_301.wav|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_302.wav|Chris is big and jolly.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_303.wav|It is quite an eye opener.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_304.wav|It became a national network.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_305.wav|They still have the dirty work to do.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_306.wav|I do not want to wait until May.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_307.wav|The festival idea has been a great success.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_308.wav|We really need research to help with that.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_309.wav|We all work for nothing.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_310.wav|It is extremely popular with families.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_311.wav|He will do very well.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_312.wav|It was a cry for help.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_313.wav|They also intend to travel today.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_314.wav|There's a lot of hysteria.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_315.wav|The casualties were not named.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_316.wav|For athletes in our current climate, their sport is their livelihood.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_317.wav|Axis itself was created from that exercise.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_318.wav|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_319.wav|It's just that we see different things.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_320.wav|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_321.wav|I am very happy with life.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_322.wav|We are all family men with children.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_323.wav|The committee's remit is far reaching.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_324.wav|We've had our problems at the club.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_325.wav|The plot is changing as time goes on.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_326.wav|They were at her bedside when she died.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_327.wav|I think we showed that after half time.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_328.wav|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.|90,,
wav48/p330/p330_329.wav|I am not in denial.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_330.wav|There is a solution, she believes.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_331.wav|Yet the data is compelling.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_332.wav|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_333.wav|There was pressure from elsewhere too.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_334.wav|What are you waiting for?|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_335.wav|It could have been just a quick fix.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_336.wav|Will he be given time?|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_337.wav|You let a lot of people down.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_338.wav|It's annoying in a way.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_339.wav|The result today is an impasse.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_340.wav|It would have to be backdated.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_341.wav|One person was believed to have been hit.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_342.wav|It is like being a qualifier again.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_343.wav|And he's the first to see that, and say that.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_344.wav|Our biggest threat is the BBC.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_345.wav|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_346.wav|She is very upset.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_347.wav|We have to learn lessons from these things.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_348.wav|It was a poor performance.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_349.wav|We are very very proud of Alain.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_350.wav|That is the consistent approach of the Government.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_351.wav|There was no sign that anything was amiss.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_352.wav|It didn't help him, as far as we had seen.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_353.wav|Head injuries are the leading cause of death.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_354.wav|It is patently true.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_355.wav|I've got my own ideas.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_356.wav|The guys have really enjoyed it.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_357.wav|They might want to play.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_358.wav|The goal will stay with me forever.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_359.wav|Our people should be immune.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_360.wav|It is simple and easy to use.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_361.wav|Today's agreement will help tackle that problem.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_362.wav|English rugby is on the brink of extinction, though, it's official.|90,,
wav48/p330/p330_363.wav|It is the way they work.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_364.wav|This was another video cassette.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_365.wav|The rear of the plane was on fire.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_366.wav|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_367.wav|I think we finished fifth.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_368.wav|Another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_369.wav|We know them as mobile telephones.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_370.wav|I have chosen to do this research.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_371.wav|That's the law of the land.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_372.wav|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_373.wav|He scored a touchdown.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_374.wav|He wouldn't do it.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_375.wav|I don't know exactly what happened.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_376.wav|They were very, very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_377.wav|We are waiting for them to calm down.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_378.wav|The Government faces a moral dilemma.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_379.wav|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_380.wav|Debate is not just talk.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_381.wav|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_382.wav|Neither was involved in violence.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_383.wav|But, because of the wood, no-one had the experience.|90,,
wav48/p330/p330_384.wav|So people will come out with these things.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_385.wav|It was a very difficult decision for us.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_386.wav|I am not a happy man.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_387.wav|Was it just negligent.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_388.wav|That would open the gates of hell.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_389.wav|If only we had known.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_390.wav|The line-up is a tasty one.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_391.wav|He was located after going to Singapore.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_392.wav|She was my big sister.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_393.wav|Meantime, his appointment has been widely welcomed.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_394.wav|They will now get that support.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_395.wav|Mr Burrell was arrested almost a year ago.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_396.wav|Then all was revealed.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_397.wav|They are interior designers and architects.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_398.wav|Suspension will come into force at midnight.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_399.wav|However, there are no plans for injecting rooms.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_400.wav|All the teachers are Afghan refugees.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_401.wav|WHAT's in a name in this, the age of the Internet?|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_402.wav|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_403.wav|They had given up on him.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_404.wav|She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_405.wav|We didn't know if people would turn up.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_406.wav|We will deal with the refugees.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_407.wav|I am greatly encouraged.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_408.wav|They offer a kind of narrative.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_409.wav|You guys are not out of it yet.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_410.wav|What does he want him to look like?|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_411.wav|You know, he was struggling with his game all week.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_412.wav|What is next?|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_413.wav|Their welfare is very important to us.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_414.wav|It's nothing to do with me.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_415.wav|She has now been registered as disabled.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_416.wav|You have to work with what you've got.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_417.wav|O Leary now intends to take a holiday.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_418.wav|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.|90,,
wav48/p330/p330_419.wav|This is about the Orange Order.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_420.wav|But it looks good for next year.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_421.wav|We will do so again.|90,,,,
wav48/p330/p330_422.wav|It's been a long, long journey.|90,,,
wav48/p330/p330_423.wav|I have no problem with that.|90,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_001.wav|Please call Stella.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|91,,
wav48/p333/p333_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|91,,
wav48/p333/p333_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|91,,
wav48/p333/p333_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not a reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|91,,
wav48/p333/p333_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|91,,
wav48/p333/p333_025.wav|He needed seven hours of surgery.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_026.wav|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_027.wav|But who shot the president?|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_028.wav|Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_030.wav|All would be under threat.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_031.wav|Some will be deployed on submarines.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_032.wav|There are moments of silence.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_033.wav|So now this series has had its day.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_034.wav|Gaelic provision continued to be good.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_035.wav|Bobby Robson called him a genius.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_036.wav|It's a policy which has worked for us.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_037.wav|They were urged to get themselves in order.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_038.wav|Too many factors are now working against him.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_039.wav|His views are hardly surprising.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_040.wav|It is time for a new approach.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_041.wav|We have nothing to say about that.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_042.wav|We've tried every other way.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_043.wav|Slowly, however, a picture is emerging in Scotland.|91,,
wav48/p333/p333_044.wav|Nobody else was with me.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_045.wav|However, the report was incorrect.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_046.wav|It does make a big difference.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_047.wav|Do not forget about Monaco.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_048.wav|Peter, of course, refuses to conform.|91,,
wav48/p333/p333_049.wav|You can't give in to the vandals.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_050.wav|Everything was an effort.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_051.wav|And does it even matter?|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_052.wav|This is the same old story.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_053.wav|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_054.wav|My parents are exhausted.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_055.wav|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.|91,,
wav48/p333/p333_056.wav|The performance was excellent.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_057.wav|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.|91,,
wav48/p333/p333_058.wav|The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_059.wav|It will come up here.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_060.wav|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_061.wav|Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_062.wav|The chief constable is right.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_063.wav|I didn't expect to get one.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_064.wav|It has been blown out of all proportion.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_065.wav|This is only the start of my season.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_066.wav|It sounded awfully like panic.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_067.wav|I've taken to the hills.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_068.wav|John was a very nice man.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_069.wav|This is a big, big win.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_070.wav|The crowd was awesome.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_071.wav|Every game against New Zealand is.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_072.wav|The jury is still out on this one.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_073.wav|My game is in pretty good shape.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_074.wav|That would have killed the match.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_075.wav|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.|91,,
wav48/p333/p333_076.wav|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_077.wav|They had not been handcuffed.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_078.wav|I think we will join the single currency.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_079.wav|Then it was the turn of the carnival.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_080.wav|But the tragedy did not stop there.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_081.wav|They wanted to show what they could do.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_082.wav|It runs until the beginning of June.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_083.wav|All of us do.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_084.wav|But will they fall in love?|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_085.wav|It was different from our other work.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_086.wav|That is in the public domain.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_087.wav|The Hague is too good for him.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_088.wav|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_089.wav|In just a fortnight, however, everything has changed.|91,,
wav48/p333/p333_090.wav|It's a true story.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_091.wav|We are looking for volunteers.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_092.wav|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_093.wav|It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_094.wav|Subs not used, McCulloch.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_095.wav|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_096.wav|He could face a jail sentence.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_097.wav|They didn't take you to mass graves.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_098.wav|There was no option.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_099.wav|Life is about people, and how you feel about people.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_100.wav|Could they perhaps be related?|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_101.wav|Happily we found it in the library.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_102.wav|We all thought we were going to die.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_103.wav|Maybe he will act again.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_104.wav|Safety was also an issue.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_105.wav|That's why he visited.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_106.wav|I know a lot of people who don't.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_107.wav|There was nobody on the roof.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_108.wav|Clark is back on top form.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_109.wav|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.|91,,
wav48/p333/p333_110.wav|It needs somebody to give way.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_111.wav|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_112.wav|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_113.wav|I'm surprised to hear it from Tony.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_114.wav|The days of empty promises are over.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_115.wav|I thought he was terrific.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_116.wav|Henry was strong and talented.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_117.wav|That left a bad taste in my mouth.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_118.wav|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_119.wav|We must improve our relations with government.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_120.wav|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_121.wav|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_122.wav|A venue was found.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_123.wav|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.|91,
wav48/p333/p333_124.wav|He said it was the worst possible result.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_125.wav|Whatever he does, however, it will be decisive.|91,,
wav48/p333/p333_126.wav|This is our way to make our point.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_127.wav|It was a disaster.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_128.wav|It is an interesting title, Believing in Britain.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_129.wav|He was back to square one.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_130.wav|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_131.wav|I have been coming here for nine years.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_132.wav|It is just part of modern day life.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_133.wav|A young Briton had a lucky escape.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_134.wav|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_135.wav|Treatment is not an issue with these people.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_136.wav|YOU thought it was a headache.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_137.wav|All the people thought that he would die.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_138.wav|It is never an easy game.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_139.wav|This year it will be Billy Crystal.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_140.wav|No-one else is like Michael Jackson.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_141.wav|The post will run for four years.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_142.wav|However, it's good to turn the page.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_143.wav|He had reason to be pleased.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_144.wav|It was important to win the singles.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_145.wav|That is impressive by any standards.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_146.wav|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_147.wav|I'm thinking, what would be easier?|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_148.wav|That alibi is now gone.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_149.wav|We actually haven't managed to meet demand.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_150.wav|The Scots are great.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_151.wav|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_152.wav|However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.|91,,
wav48/p333/p333_153.wav|I will certainly be having words with him.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_154.wav|She is a valuable member of the Government.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_155.wav|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_156.wav|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_157.wav|But he is not using them.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_158.wav|Christians in Pakistan are terrified.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_159.wav|I cannot believe she has been admonished.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_160.wav|We are not moving in.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_161.wav|It was a breathtaking moment.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_162.wav|That's been our position all along.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_163.wav|I was in jail for five years.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_164.wav|There are no charges.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_165.wav|His funeral is not expected until next week.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_166.wav|Its effect on humans is not yet known.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_167.wav|I am very, very happy.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_168.wav|They got the job done.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_169.wav|They tried to give her advice.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_170.wav|They won the trophy in the Hoops.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_171.wav|It is true, but it is only part of the issue.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_172.wav|It's going to be epic.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_173.wav|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.|91,,
wav48/p333/p333_174.wav|It was large enough to fit the wall.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_175.wav|He just carried on filming.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_176.wav|He will be judged by his actions.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_177.wav|I never found my rhythm.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_178.wav|I didn't mean to kill her.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_179.wav|It is a job creation scheme.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_180.wav|In less than two months, the women have achieved a lot.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_181.wav|We might be back next year.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_182.wav|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_183.wav|The same goes for personnel.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_184.wav|In a way he was.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_185.wav|This area is perfect for children.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_186.wav|No, they have not.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_187.wav|The feeling between the two men was mutual.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_188.wav|That was a hard game to play in, very tough.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_189.wav|I was chosen to do this.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_190.wav|The weekly average was three hours.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_191.wav|When he took over it really took off.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_192.wav|I have been very nervous.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_193.wav|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_194.wav|There was an element of jealousy.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_195.wav|There was no happy ending.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_196.wav|Craig is still suffering seizures.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_197.wav|I didn't play well last year.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_198.wav|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.|91,,
wav48/p333/p333_199.wav|That certainly brought me back down to earth.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_200.wav|Now it has been eclipsed.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_201.wav|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_202.wav|We have no idea what caused the derailment.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_203.wav|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_204.wav|It is legally binding.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_205.wav|It has come as a bombshell.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_206.wav|Before the games it was pretty open.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_207.wav|We didn't know he was even out.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_208.wav|He is only now regaining his confidence.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_209.wav|Singing has gone out of fashion.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_210.wav|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_211.wav|They must be kept on the ground.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_212.wav|We still don't know.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_213.wav|Police have appealed for witnesses.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_215.wav|This is a foolish idea.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_216.wav|It separates the men from the boys.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_217.wav|I've invented a village in East Lothian.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_218.wav|Or some thought that they have.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_219.wav|If only we had known.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_220.wav|This process of attrition is expected to continue.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_221.wav|A Treasury spokesman derided the Tory charge.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_222.wav|You'll get on like a house on fire.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_223.wav|Two and a half million people have died.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_224.wav|It could not be too high.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_225.wav|How many cases have there been?|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_226.wav|I hope they understand that.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_227.wav|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_228.wav|But Annika is just amazing.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_229.wav|Our job is to change that.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_230.wav|She will also get a pay rise.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_231.wav|It's because they can't understand the language.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_232.wav|It is time for a more honest approach.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_233.wav|That is very, very bad news for our nation.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_234.wav|Nobody can change it overnight, but you can make a start.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_235.wav|What's it all about?|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_236.wav|It is a big time for me.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_237.wav|There were two things going on at once.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_238.wav|It's something we want to make work.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_239.wav|I want to play at the highest level.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_240.wav|We are all equal.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_241.wav|That is the key message.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_242.wav|It ignores the future.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_243.wav|This is the subway.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_244.wav|Altman has every right to be bitter.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_245.wav|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_246.wav|We were hopeful that it would be successful.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_247.wav|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_248.wav|It is a weakness, and not the only one.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_249.wav|He's in with the furniture.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_250.wav|There are two games to go after that.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_251.wav|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_252.wav|Who will provide the wine?|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_253.wav|We are still getting signals.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_254.wav|What's it got to do with them, anyway?|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_255.wav|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_256.wav|We started from scratch.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_257.wav|Nothing is being offered in exchange.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_258.wav|There are a few changes.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_259.wav|You're not going to get hurt.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_260.wav|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_261.wav|The New Deal will constantly be improved.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_262.wav|THE headless man has finally developed a face.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_263.wav|I heard some of his remarks.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_264.wav|Eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_265.wav|It has to be funded.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_266.wav|Mary Archer is almost too clever.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_267.wav|I was just overwhelmed.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_268.wav|It had been in place since last July.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_269.wav|It was very frightened and dirty.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_270.wav|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_271.wav|I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_272.wav|That's a very strong element.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_273.wav|How much of a cop out is that?|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_274.wav|The whole region is in shock.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_275.wav|It was a journey into a new life.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_276.wav|It's a way of making a mark.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_277.wav|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_278.wav|You were the kidnappers.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_279.wav|It is a very interesting subject.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_280.wav|We know we can't rely on you.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_281.wav|Arguably, they have already done it.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_282.wav|It was indeed a night to remember.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_283.wav|It doesn't appear to be anything too serious.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_284.wav|There is something in this.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_285.wav|I could feel the blood on my face.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_286.wav|That's why he plays for Scotland.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_287.wav|There are no plans to change this.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_288.wav|It's too big a risk to take.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_289.wav|It's going to be quite a challenge.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_290.wav|I have heard the stories from Scotland.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_291.wav|It is just too long since the war.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_292.wav|My wife is totally behind me on this.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_293.wav|Debbie Harry was cool.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_294.wav|Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_295.wav|We are the British National Party, not the English National Party.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_296.wav|That sort of thing is long gone.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_297.wav|And sooner than we may think.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_298.wav|Raised the way you want it.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_299.wav|However, consumers may take a different view.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_300.wav|I know you went back this morning.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_301.wav|I will carry on.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_302.wav|A review of the decision is being sought.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_303.wav|I made a mistake.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_304.wav|It is a very special city.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_305.wav|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_306.wav|They certainly do not socialise.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_307.wav|It's my favourite place to hang out.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_308.wav|I think that could work to our advantage.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_309.wav|Was that not awful?|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_310.wav|That was him under pressure.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_311.wav|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_312.wav|He will make an excellent chief inspector.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_313.wav|I'm not blaming audiences.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_315.wav|The Government has to grasp the nettle.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_316.wav|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.|91,,
wav48/p333/p333_317.wav|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_318.wav|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_319.wav|I was doing well at the hustings.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_320.wav|We will just get on with it.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_321.wav|We are worried about casualties.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_322.wav|This is my music.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_323.wav|I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_324.wav|I haven't won the world title.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_325.wav|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_326.wav|It's fantastic to have finally won.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_327.wav|But she's also beautiful behind the face.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_328.wav|And now he tells us.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_329.wav|I am not changing my event.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_330.wav|Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_331.wav|This Patton will also return.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_332.wav|That is as it may be.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_333.wav|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.|91,,
wav48/p333/p333_334.wav|He came in an army uniform.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_335.wav|Eleven events are required.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_336.wav|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_337.wav|You encourage them - you can do it.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_338.wav|The winner will be announced by early summer.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_339.wav|I always said No.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_340.wav|The stadium was full.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_341.wav|Cinema is a communal experience.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_342.wav|So, how will it be received in the US?|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_343.wav|He was different from the rest of us.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_344.wav|His name is Michael Owen.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_345.wav|He's got a great chance of making it.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_346.wav|Tartan Day is not a Scottish event.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_347.wav|For now, we must take one game at a time.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_348.wav|So now you know.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_349.wav|But, at the same time, they made you think about life.|91,,
wav48/p333/p333_350.wav|I didn't want to ignore the punters.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_351.wav|I foolishly had done nothing about it.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_352.wav|The feeling is awesome.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_353.wav|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_354.wav|Smith has not let him down.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_355.wav|We have obviously got some work to do.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_356.wav|Which he can do.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_357.wav|No, it's actually in a block of flats.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_358.wav|It has been recorded twice.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_359.wav|They were that poor.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_360.wav|And we're talking Big Money.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_361.wav|His silence on the issue is interesting.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_362.wav|They have two children.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_363.wav|With Pierre, you can never be sure.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_364.wav|Here is a tale of devotion to duty.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_365.wav|I'm really proud of my young players.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_366.wav|People buy everything with cash.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_367.wav|There was a great support all round the route.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_368.wav|They should feel ashamed.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_369.wav|I felt we had fallen back a little.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_370.wav|Both managements are very supportive.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_371.wav|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_372.wav|I'll go out and be aggressive.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_373.wav|This is important for two reasons.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_374.wav|I'm just looking to take my chances.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_375.wav|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_376.wav|You will not feel a thing.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_377.wav|It's been like that for ages, according to the guys.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_378.wav|It's not just for classical music.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_379.wav|This must be kept in total perspective.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_380.wav|All of the names are familiar to me.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_381.wav|There are moments of honesty, too.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_382.wav|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.|91,,
wav48/p333/p333_383.wav|Is that where we are?|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_384.wav|We used to keep our business rates.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_385.wav|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_386.wav|But there's no eye contact.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_387.wav|There was no energy behind it.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_388.wav|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_389.wav|Have we not had the rainy season already?|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_390.wav|We have chosen for the patients.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_391.wav|They have not allowed them to defend themselves.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_392.wav|It is not a wish list.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_393.wav|He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_394.wav|If not, he should go home.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_395.wav|There is no margin for error.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_396.wav|Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_397.wav|I get very excited by that.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_398.wav|Anyway, she is playing a lesbian.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_399.wav|In the end, it will mean an awful lot.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_400.wav|Which means it matters.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_401.wav|I think it can count against you now.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_402.wav|There is a great potential on this river.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_403.wav|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_404.wav|She said he showed no remorse.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_405.wav|They hold on for many years.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_406.wav|After New Labour, we now have New Unionists.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_407.wav|However, there are signs of dissent among his collies.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_408.wav|There's nothing for you here.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_409.wav|Home is in the Scottish Borders.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_410.wav|Officials say the city must achieve this.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_411.wav|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_412.wav|I have not come in to take over.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_413.wav|Is this accurate?|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_414.wav|A judicial review is also being considered.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_415.wav|I want to win this thing.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_416.wav|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|91,,
wav48/p333/p333_417.wav|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.|91,,
wav48/p333/p333_418.wav|I'd just like to play.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_419.wav|They were in good humour, too.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_420.wav|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_421.wav|Three months or so later, they are returning.|91,,,
wav48/p333/p333_422.wav|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_423.wav|I don't know why you say goodbye.|91,,,,
wav48/p333/p333_424.wav|Appointed general secretary last September.|91,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_001.wav|Please call Stella.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|92,,
wav48/p334/p334_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|92,,
wav48/p334/p334_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|92,,
wav48/p334/p334_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|92,,
wav48/p334/p334_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|92,,
wav48/p334/p334_025.wav|A judicial review is also being considered.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_026.wav|I want to win this thing.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_027.wav|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|92,,
wav48/p334/p334_028.wav|I'd just like to play.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_029.wav|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_030.wav|Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_031.wav|It was no surprise.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_032.wav|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_033.wav|I don't know why you say goodbye.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_034.wav|Appointed general secretary last September.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_035.wav|Headteachers want their pupils to conform.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_036.wav|We could feel the heat.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_037.wav|Darrell was, however, adamant.|92,,
wav48/p334/p334_038.wav|He was a member of the Tartan Army.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_039.wav|I think it can count against you now.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_040.wav|I wanted to win so badly.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_041.wav|It was an accounting error.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_042.wav|I had enough on.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_043.wav|The offer of help is there for anyone.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_044.wav|There were no passengers on board.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_045.wav|And we're not there yet.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_046.wav|No meaningful response was issued.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_047.wav|And the funny thing is, they usually do.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_048.wav|Times have changed, but have they improved?|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_049.wav|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_050.wav|We feel it sends out the wrong message.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_051.wav|Later we discovered it was a hoax.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_052.wav|It is a form of physical exercise.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_053.wav|plays in dark blue.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_054.wav|But, by that time, of course, it is again.|92,
wav48/p334/p334_055.wav|It is something that we will put right.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_056.wav|Why do it?|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_057.wav|It could take three days.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_058.wav|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_059.wav|It was totally my fault.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_060.wav|Or so everyone believed.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_061.wav|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_062.wav|Perhaps we should do the same.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_063.wav|Tomorrow night is the important game.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_064.wav|He's very good at relating to adults.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_065.wav|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_066.wav|Every aspect of our play was first class.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_067.wav|Every school in Scotland should be excellent.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_068.wav|It was a move which appealed to him.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_069.wav|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_070.wav|He will need that machine.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_071.wav|But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_072.wav|We are looking for volunteers.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_073.wav|I had a sense of deja vu.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_074.wav|It was very personal and very intimate.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_075.wav|By this point the couple were approaching fast.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_076.wav|I was inspired by two things.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_077.wav|They follow him everywhere.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_078.wav|I couldn't make out what was going on.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_079.wav|Maybe that was the whole point.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_080.wav|The feeling between the two men was mutual.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_081.wav|They just thought it was extremely good acting.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_082.wav|So we said, no, we're not going to do that.|92,,
wav48/p334/p334_083.wav|This must be really short of ideas.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_084.wav|It was extremely cold.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_085.wav|They use them for everything.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_086.wav|We have the easy part.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_087.wav|I had a choice, and didn't have to do that.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_088.wav|They will pass it on to Jim Wallace, the justice minister.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_089.wav|The rubble was right up to the ceiling.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_090.wav|Mr Miller is married with three children.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_091.wav|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_092.wav|We already have them, all over Europe.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_093.wav|There are a lot of unanswered questions.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_094.wav|Libya is an easy target.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_095.wav|I thought they played very well.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_096.wav|It was a foolhardy decision.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_097.wav|It means they actually control the programme.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_098.wav|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?|92,,
wav48/p334/p334_099.wav|They chose to side with terror.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_100.wav|Justice was not seen today.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_101.wav|I would never even consider it.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_102.wav|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_103.wav|We should just say no.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_104.wav|We are not out of touch with politics.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_105.wav|That was a gold medal for certain.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_106.wav|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_107.wav|I didn't make those adjustments.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_108.wav|We are satisfied with this outcome.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_109.wav|We have it on video.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_110.wav|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_111.wav|There is an element of racism in Scotland.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_112.wav|It didn't take long.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_113.wav|This meeting is the path to salvation.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_114.wav|Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_115.wav|I was very pleased with them today, though.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_116.wav|If you're going to do it, do it right.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_117.wav|He told the conference.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_118.wav|The sanctions are about collective punishment.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_119.wav|We tend to come good at the end.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_120.wav|He also received a medal of honour.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_121.wav|It's not one for the purist.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_122.wav|It may now be too expensive for anyone.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_123.wav|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_124.wav|He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_125.wav|There is bound to be a formal complaint.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_126.wav|It is a time bomb.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_127.wav|It's a matter of huge concern.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_128.wav|This could be a recipe for conflict.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_129.wav|We are taking advice on this.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_130.wav|I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_131.wav|It was just an accident of birth.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_132.wav|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_133.wav|It was a simple question.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_134.wav|Some of his family still live there.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_135.wav|I've no doubt about it, it was actually from her.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_136.wav|By that time, however, it was already too late.|92,,
wav48/p334/p334_137.wav|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_138.wav|Could you put it in writing?|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_139.wav|This is the New Edinburgh.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_140.wav|We all thought we were going to die.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_141.wav|And that's good news for the magpies.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_142.wav|That will come after the game on Saturday.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_143.wav|Our offer will remain on the table.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_144.wav|The world is split into two.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_145.wav|They deserve a lot of credit.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_146.wav|I would ask the fans to be patient.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_147.wav|It was so physical.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_148.wav|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_149.wav|He always has been, since his early days with the Scottish Opera.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_150.wav|Why is that?|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_151.wav|It is extremely sad.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_153.wav|Europe is a hugely contentious issue.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_154.wav|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_155.wav|And therein lies the whole problem.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_156.wav|He was not deterred.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_157.wav|This commitment should be built upon.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_158.wav|This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.|92,,
wav48/p334/p334_159.wav|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_160.wav|That is not just my personal view.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_161.wav|The investment will be in the food.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_162.wav|But he was a full, working member of our staff.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_163.wav|The problem is the pitch.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_164.wav|That's as it should be.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_165.wav|It does seem a mystery.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_166.wav|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.|92,,
wav48/p334/p334_167.wav|He looked very sharp.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_168.wav|The fate of large numbers remains unknown.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_169.wav|Two of the team became ill.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_170.wav|We have taken steps to rectify it.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_171.wav|I see no need for change.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_172.wav|Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_173.wav|But the Premiership is everything to us.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_174.wav|Do yourselves a favour.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_175.wav|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_176.wav|But we have come under attack.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_177.wav|The new system will be marketed this summer.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_178.wav|What do they do, anyway?|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_179.wav|He was just like a godfather to it.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_180.wav|I'd love to be like Peter.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_181.wav|I disagree entirely with the decision.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_182.wav|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_183.wav|That is his attitude to things.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_184.wav|Then came the collision with Sergio.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_185.wav|And what was that like, as an experience?|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_186.wav|Thirteen people will be made redundant.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_187.wav|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_188.wav|No finals are to be contested today.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_189.wav|This is not a struggle against Islam.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_190.wav|That night was a terrible muddle.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_191.wav|His English counterpart agreed.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_192.wav|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_193.wav|It is in our own hands.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_194.wav|This is a step backwards.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_195.wav|We may make a short-term appointment.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_196.wav|He will address the nation this evening.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_197.wav|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_198.wav|I'm not changing my mind.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_199.wav|I shall be voting Yes to support him.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_200.wav|We believe that the reason is poverty.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_201.wav|Tony Blair is obviously panicking.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_202.wav|We welcome this increase in the minimum wage.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_203.wav|The children, were not thought to be so seriously hurt.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_204.wav|I'm trying to stay open on that.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_205.wav|They serve a multitude of purposes.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_206.wav|We'll have to work hard today.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_207.wav|The frustration was showing.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_208.wav|Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_209.wav|It is the stop-gap before extinction.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_210.wav|You have obviously got an answer to it.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_211.wav|My friends were very envious.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_212.wav|But who cares?|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_213.wav|The house was full of smoke.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_214.wav|The approval system will be changed.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_215.wav|So the European elections are extremely important.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_216.wav|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_217.wav|That period was a struggle.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_218.wav|We are determined to establish the facts.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_219.wav|You just have to accept.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_220.wav|We must improve our relations with government.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_221.wav|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_222.wav|The list is too long for this piece.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_223.wav|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_224.wav|I can't blame the fans.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_225.wav|That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_226.wav|Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_227.wav|But that attachment took a lot of growing.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_228.wav|This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_229.wav|However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.|92,
wav48/p334/p334_230.wav|So far they have refused.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_231.wav|He is adamant that he is innocent.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_232.wav|To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_233.wav|The hearing in Edinburgh continues.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_234.wav|He took my breath away.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_235.wav|It's good fun, and makes it so much more interesting.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_236.wav|I will have to order its destruction.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_237.wav|After that it is up to the boss.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_238.wav|I never wanted a legal battle.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_239.wav|This influence, to the audience, is like an arrow.|92,,
wav48/p334/p334_240.wav|Downing Street defended the scale of the awards.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_241.wav|It had won an investors in people award.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_242.wav|A venue was found.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_243.wav|They are not an item.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_244.wav|Basically, the classical tradition won out.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_245.wav|Is that Titanic?|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_246.wav|He was to get his chance.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_247.wav|So, the question is, is it any good?|92,,
wav48/p334/p334_248.wav|I'll always remember the horrible images.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_249.wav|That's why they go to the opera.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_250.wav|Well, it's not before time, is it?|92,,
wav48/p334/p334_251.wav|They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_252.wav|The trouble is, though,there is no simple solution.|92,,
wav48/p334/p334_253.wav|I'm getting back up there now.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_254.wav|Check that he is dead.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_255.wav|I couldn't see any reason not to die.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_256.wav|My players have no idea about football.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_257.wav|They are there to get people into work.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_258.wav|The balance isn't there at EMI.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_259.wav|I am getting long in the tooth.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_260.wav|They would be wise to do just that.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_261.wav|He was sentenced to seven years.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_262.wav|That, he claimed, was essential.|92,,
wav48/p334/p334_263.wav|I would like Glasgow.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_264.wav|Strathclyde Police yesterday declined to comment on Ferris.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_265.wav|It felt like my support system was leaving.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_266.wav|Some old favourites remain in varying forms.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_267.wav|The weaknesses are few.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_268.wav|I may think about performing it.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_269.wav|I would recommend it.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_270.wav|Crucially, though, United were still alive.|92,,
wav48/p334/p334_271.wav|Charles Gordon, leader of the Glasgow City Council declined to comment.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_272.wav|She'd gone to the Catholic school.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_273.wav|Where was their passion, the power and feeling?|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_274.wav|You can't go back and change things.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_275.wav|We are on a four-year mission.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_276.wav|This is a lie.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_277.wav|Instead, it is back to the drawing board.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_278.wav|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.|92,,
wav48/p334/p334_279.wav|Its national defence policy is defensive in nature.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_280.wav|They should stop the bombing.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_281.wav|They'll have to pay more.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_282.wav|Military chiefs were playing it straight.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_283.wav|Does it, Noel?|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_284.wav|Adams is surely worth a chance.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_285.wav|I will never manage another Scottish club.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_286.wav|The Open champion is back.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_287.wav|It's going to be a new challenge.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_288.wav|It's the taking part that counts.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_289.wav|They married in August last year.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_290.wav|I want to keep him.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_291.wav|We haven't actually considered it down here.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_292.wav|You've been a great audience.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_293.wav|He was telling me to keep quiet.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_294.wav|By then, however, both men were already in the US.|92,,
wav48/p334/p334_295.wav|We were given a warm and friendly reception.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_296.wav|He also wants to play in this game, and that's important.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_297.wav|We have been extremely lucky this time.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_298.wav|People are fed up.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_299.wav|Her grand-daughter was uninjured.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_300.wav|It's a sign of the times.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_301.wav|But that night they killed her housekeeper.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_302.wav|I just need a bit of luck.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_303.wav|Once we have done that, the tender will be put out.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_304.wav|Sightings were replaced by rumours.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_305.wav|He is a Satan.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_306.wav|I always felt they played for me.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_307.wav|If they don't, they can expect their funding to be cut.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_308.wav|They must be kept on the ground.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_309.wav|Again, it's about responding to your resources.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_310.wav|However, pensions and salaries have yet to be settled.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_311.wav|The whole nation will be delighted.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_312.wav|The public have been very supportive.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_313.wav|We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_314.wav|No sooner had we got it, than we wanted it different.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_315.wav|The hotel was now for sale.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_316.wav|There are two games to go after that.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_317.wav|It seems a little short to me.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_318.wav|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_319.wav|It's ahead of Labour.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_320.wav|His replacement was named yesterday, following inquiries by The Herald.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_321.wav|I welcome this new service.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_322.wav|Then it developed into civil and criminal.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_323.wav|She now suffers from multiple sclerosis.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_324.wav|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_325.wav|It was a UK-wide report.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_326.wav|The law should be changed.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_327.wav|This is a dreadful day for Iona.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_328.wav|He spoke about the choices facing them, and their country.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_329.wav|I will be standing.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_330.wav|Lara is very, very much a girl.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_331.wav|It could be done by experts and lawyers.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_332.wav|Are you from the rugby?|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_333.wav|The attack was totally unprovoked.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_334.wav|The plot is simple.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_335.wav|They've not let anyone into the loop.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_336.wav|So just what is her enduring appeal?|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_337.wav|With actors it is slightly different.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_338.wav|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_339.wav|Last night was a key episode.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_340.wav|What did we learn?|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_341.wav|Looking at him is proof of the pudding.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_342.wav|I knew he was dying.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_343.wav|He's a key player in Scotland.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_344.wav|He loved his children.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_345.wav|She wondered why we were interested.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_346.wav|The story was being repeated across Scotland.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_347.wav|An appeal was made to the presiding officer.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_348.wav|I am content with the silver.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_349.wav|People acted too quickly.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_350.wav|This, too, could provoke a risky business.|92,,
wav48/p334/p334_351.wav|We took the chances when they came.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_352.wav|You have to audition for jobs.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_353.wav|What would you do if you didn't work?|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_354.wav|Ferguson should take note.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_355.wav|We have always been, and remain confident of the securing of order.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_356.wav|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_357.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_358.wav|They've got three-quarters of the way.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_359.wav|It gave no further details.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_360.wav|This man is serious about his work.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_361.wav|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.|92,,
wav48/p334/p334_362.wav|She was released from hospital yesterday.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_363.wav|Her mother said, She didn't look very well at all.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_364.wav|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_365.wav|The move follows a review of the Singapore|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_366.wav|We will miss him very much.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_367.wav|This was a chilling echo.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_368.wav|As a nation, we must become more active.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_369.wav|This gives a financial incentive to switch.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_370.wav|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_371.wav|January is a bad time of year.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_372.wav|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_373.wav|Liberal Democrat leader makes the hash of it.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_374.wav|They are a very powerful and tasty side.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_375.wav|This is a huge boost for my confidence.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_376.wav|I'm delighted for Simon.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_377.wav|His third goal was superb.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_378.wav|Here we have not had one hour.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_379.wav|He said to me, Which one, son?|92,,
wav48/p334/p334_380.wav|I don't have a problem with getting older.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_381.wav|His son is a local legend.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_382.wav|I was so nervous.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_383.wav|The attacker has been put in foster care.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_384.wav|His death was a tragic accident.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_385.wav|It's to do with context.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_386.wav|This fight is not going to go away.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_387.wav|At present it is fairly uncommon, but its incidence is increasing.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_388.wav|I just don't know where he is.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_389.wav|Would you take them?|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_390.wav|I find it puzzling and disturbing.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_391.wav|Golf is an expensive game for beginners.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_392.wav|He would take up the bike.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_393.wav|A world away from Rangers, you might say.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_394.wav|He sat down at the piano.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_395.wav|His condition was stable last night.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_396.wav|The sun is worth a million dollars.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_397.wav|Being captain of this club is fantastic.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_398.wav|I'm sure they love it.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_399.wav|I'd never seen a play about me.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_400.wav|The track is currently covered in snow.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_401.wav|And they all had these other commitments.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_402.wav|The report is due out next month.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_403.wav|It was nerve-racking to watch.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_404.wav|We are going to change our party.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_405.wav|It's the same as Glasgow.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_406.wav|This seems like a very good idea.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_407.wav|My wife and family are the support system.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_408.wav|It remains in public ownership.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_409.wav|The Master was by then just too old.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_410.wav|All credit to them, they took their chances, we didn't.|92,,
wav48/p334/p334_411.wav|He added, We are not prepared for war.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_412.wav|Sub Not Used, McArthur.|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_413.wav|The hangover was Olympian.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_414.wav|We are here for the long term.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_415.wav|More likely, perhaps, is that he will stay in England.|92,,
wav48/p334/p334_416.wav|A great deal has been achieved.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_417.wav|Some things in life you have to accept.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_418.wav|However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.|92,,
wav48/p334/p334_419.wav|This is a thoroughly handsome and enjoyable production.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_420.wav|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_421.wav|I think it is totally wrong.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_422.wav|It's not realistic because it's early days.|92,,,,
wav48/p334/p334_423.wav|It is par for the course, isn't it?|92,,,
wav48/p334/p334_424.wav|Sutton is playing as well as ever today.|92,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_001.wav|Please call Stella.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|93,,
wav48/p335/p335_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|93,,
wav48/p335/p335_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|93,,
wav48/p335/p335_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|93,,
wav48/p335/p335_025.wav|He was born in London of Scottish parents.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_026.wav|Her condition last night was described as critical.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_027.wav|I believe in the Church.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_028.wav|Let's not go overboard.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_029.wav|Frankly, it was worth the booking.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_030.wav|They tend to be easily influenced by others.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_031.wav|It's about bringing people in, breaking down barriers.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_032.wav|Well, what do you know?|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_033.wav|But she was very human.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_034.wav|There are some serious ethical issues involved.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_035.wav|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_036.wav|Pupils and staff were sent home early.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_037.wav|There were no proposals on the table.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_038.wav|Who does he think will win?|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_039.wav|He will emerge as a world leader.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_040.wav|It opens the door to the Champions League.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_041.wav|I only half believed it.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_042.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_043.wav|All the oil companies are talking together.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_044.wav|The failings are serious.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_045.wav|The prognosis is excellent.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_046.wav|Rangers deserved to beat us.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_047.wav|That, though, is the measure of the man.|93,,
wav48/p335/p335_048.wav|On reflection, it is more than that.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_049.wav|It is not normal practice.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_050.wav|But he just carried on anyway.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_051.wav|They couldn't believe what had happened.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_052.wav|I would not want to be young again.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_053.wav|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_054.wav|The Yugoslav army will still be there.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_055.wav|There are schoolboys in uniform.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_056.wav|I don't want to hear any excuses.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_057.wav|They were later discharged from hospital.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_058.wav|Let's see that increase over the years.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_059.wav|I've learned a lot, and tomorrow is another day.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_060.wav|These findings would be made public.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_061.wav|It's the most beautiful place on earth.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_062.wav|I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.|93,,
wav48/p335/p335_063.wav|I've learned from my mistakes.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_064.wav|This must be wrong.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_065.wav|He added later, Normally, it's not a dangerous river.|93,,
wav48/p335/p335_066.wav|It probably didn't feel anything, she added.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_067.wav|I go home only once.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_068.wav|I am delighted to hear this wonderful news.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_069.wav|It is a family day out.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_070.wav|On that basis, he would set it aside.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_071.wav|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.|93,,
wav48/p335/p335_072.wav|Bin Laden was not mentioned.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_073.wav|Seven people were later detained by police.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_074.wav|The team this year is going places.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_075.wav|We should do everything at a stroke.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_076.wav|He had a moustache.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_077.wav|It's just for me.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_078.wav|History is usually written by the victors.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_079.wav|It plans to return to this field.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_080.wav|He said because people had invited him.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_081.wav|That would be dangerous.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_082.wav|Its workforce is to be made redundant.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_083.wav|We aim to put them out of business.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_084.wav|They're completely different from each other.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_085.wav|He was extremely nervous.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_086.wav|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_087.wav|Correction, knowing him, he might.|93,,
wav48/p335/p335_088.wav|I came up through the ranks.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_089.wav|We still don't know what's happened.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_090.wav|His team management was protective.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_091.wav|The proposal was rejected.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_092.wav|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_093.wav|We wanted it left for a wee while.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_094.wav|Four other charges were dropped.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_095.wav|These guys will not lie down.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_096.wav|I would think they are just behind them.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_097.wav|You can expect a hell of a fuss.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_098.wav|Harrowing is easy, after all.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_099.wav|That is nearly four people every day.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_100.wav|There are nine people here now.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_101.wav|I like what has happened!|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_102.wav|This would not be my first choice.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_103.wav|We knew nothing about it.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_104.wav|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.|93,,
wav48/p335/p335_105.wav|Which perhaps is just as well.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_106.wav|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_107.wav|They receive a high profile in the media.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_108.wav|They have got their position, we have got our position.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_109.wav|There will be plenty to keep them occupied.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_110.wav|Or was it?|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_111.wav|It is not fair.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_112.wav|I saw military vehicles in the distance.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_113.wav|Few other services in Scotland are affected, the spokesman said.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_114.wav|The dealer is on notice.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_115.wav|But it will backfire.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_116.wav|We kept going right to the final whistle.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_117.wav|Police were also perplexed.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_118.wav|For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_119.wav|Britain may now be forced to listen.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_120.wav|JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.|93,,
wav48/p335/p335_121.wav|The final stage is paranoia.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_122.wav|I am not holding the club to ransom.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_123.wav|Wagner was never like this.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_124.wav|The plane was in flames|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_125.wav|We represent a wide range of society.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_126.wav|Pig farmers are completely despondent.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_127.wav|I've seen some of the submissions.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_128.wav|It was meant to rival the dollar.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_129.wav|A win was a real achievement.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_130.wav|This is the high point of my career.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_131.wav|That's the sort of game you want.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_132.wav|My duty is to win.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_133.wav|Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_134.wav|We are trying to clarify the issues.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_135.wav|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_136.wav|Suddenly, directing was the thing he wanted to do.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_137.wav|I am prepared to help make it happen.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_138.wav|This is not presently the case.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_139.wav|It was a moment of madness.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_140.wav|Don't even bother applying.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_141.wav|We haven't seen from the Bank of Scotland.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_142.wav|I do not own the vessel in question.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_143.wav|Racism has no place in any sport.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_144.wav|It's all too short term.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_145.wav|It's too big a risk to take.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_146.wav|Mummy believed in one thing above all.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_147.wav|It was worth a photograph.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_148.wav|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_149.wav|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_150.wav|The pilot was making a visual approach.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_151.wav|I'd say we should give it a week.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_152.wav|The elections should have no role in this.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_153.wav|There was a lot of resentment.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_154.wav|Where is the anthrax?|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_155.wav|I think, at last, the company will find itself again.|93,,
wav48/p335/p335_156.wav|Filtering through this material a composite finally emerges.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_157.wav|It's because they can't understand the language.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_158.wav|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_159.wav|He realises he has hit a glass ceiling.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_160.wav|This is good news for the Western Isles.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_161.wav|It's been a good year.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_162.wav|We've got the top three.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_163.wav|But the price has been very high.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_164.wav|I'm very surprised and obviously delighted.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_165.wav|That nation is South Africa.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_166.wav|This will secure the future of our industry.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_167.wav|It's just a normal life.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_168.wav|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_169.wav|Where is the structure?|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_170.wav|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_171.wav|There's still time for that.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_172.wav|That's when you hope to take advantage.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_173.wav|He is the example for all of us.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_174.wav|It was an empowering journey.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_175.wav|Stewart will travel with some confidence.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_176.wav|Laura is an investment banker.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_177.wav|Teams are always interesting to watch.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_178.wav|Market research indicates that this is not feasible.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_179.wav|They had been together for about three years.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_180.wav|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_181.wav|Our customers come first.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_182.wav|Children are using books in a terrible condition.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_183.wav|Whether this return was too soon.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_184.wav|We didn't think anything would happen.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_185.wav|He had come of age.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_186.wav|McCall is unlikely to change a winning team.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_187.wav|We do things in an appropriate way.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_188.wav|We just want to get stuck in now.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_189.wav|Do you come from Moscow?|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_190.wav|Broomfield was the centre of the town.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_191.wav|It's hard, but if we don't do it, nobody will.|93,,
wav48/p335/p335_192.wav|That wasn't for me.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_193.wav|I am delighted with today's win.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_194.wav|We are aware of the tribunal case.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_195.wav|The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_196.wav|We should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_197.wav|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_198.wav|He added, It is all about the search for power.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_199.wav|There we were on the first tee.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_200.wav|Next time around, it will be different.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_201.wav|Broke the birdie record.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_202.wav|I looked forward to it.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_203.wav|That is a brand name.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_204.wav|She was an only child.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_205.wav|It is best value.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_206.wav|The text is reduced to bubbles.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_207.wav|They should come forward.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_208.wav|We don't say there was a massacre.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_209.wav|That has not changed.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_210.wav|John Lennon is a very large industry.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_211.wav|The island will never recover.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_212.wav|We are not ruling it out.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_213.wav|You saw the pain he was in.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_214.wav|That is not an easy thing.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_215.wav|Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_216.wav|Those who are unwilling or unable to improve.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_217.wav|This doesn't have to be our future.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_218.wav|It is a court case.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_219.wav|She was a delightful person.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_220.wav|They will have to make changes.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_221.wav|The next one comes up.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_222.wav|This fact is supported by audience research.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_223.wav|Of further privacy, he had no need.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_224.wav|We have great sympathy with Danny.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_225.wav|Come to that, is any of this really happening?|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_226.wav|Both sides have to step back.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_227.wav|This is wonderful news.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_228.wav|My dad was working in Ayrshire.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_229.wav|But if they were there, they were keeping a low profile.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_230.wav|It shows that painting is still relevant.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_231.wav|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_232.wav|It sounds a bit of an own goal.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_233.wav|We are ready for the long haul.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_234.wav|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_235.wav|This is a big step up.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_236.wav|I don't have any answer for them.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_237.wav|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_238.wav|I look for dancers who are also actors.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_239.wav|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_240.wav|EMI is a prime example.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_241.wav|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_242.wav|You cannot allow it to go on.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_243.wav|It's a record label, not a form of music.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_244.wav|Not that Agassi was a believer.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_245.wav|A friendship that will endure.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_246.wav|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_247.wav|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_248.wav|I am deeply sorry they did.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_249.wav|Nowadays, it is workers united.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_250.wav|Alex is a big part of that future.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_251.wav|Who would have thought it?|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_252.wav|I think he was surprised.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_253.wav|I played well on Saturday and again today.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_254.wav|Finally action had been taken.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_255.wav|Then there's the problem of sympathy.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_256.wav|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.|93,,
wav48/p335/p335_257.wav|That gives us a bit of a chance.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_258.wav|I watched a game.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_259.wav|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_260.wav|Blair is very positive at European Councils.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_261.wav|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.|93,,
wav48/p335/p335_262.wav|Intensive care has been very busy.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_263.wav|There was no let-up for the minnows.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_264.wav|I try not to expect anything.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_265.wav|This is my home town.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_266.wav|I think we've got the balance right.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_267.wav|We will build upon the basic state pension.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_268.wav|I have good memories of Glasgow.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_269.wav|Nothing can bring back their son.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_270.wav|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.|93,,
wav48/p335/p335_271.wav|Some may end up in hospital.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_272.wav|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_273.wav|The council has been open and transparent.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_274.wav|We can do nothing about that.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_275.wav|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_276.wav|That is highly unfair.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_277.wav|There is great demand for human cloning.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_278.wav|I'm very tired, but it was worth it.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_279.wav|Or rather he did and he didn't.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_280.wav|Scots actors should be so lucky.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_281.wav|Government sources said, It is building up.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_282.wav|Arsenal considered the job done.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_283.wav|I think it will make a huge difference.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_284.wav|Bob Dylan is getting old.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_285.wav|The company yesterday refused to comment.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_286.wav|Maybe we expected too much from the fixture.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_287.wav|Others were even less confident.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_288.wav|I just want to change my life.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_289.wav|On occasions he succeeded.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_290.wav|He did not oppose the divorce.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_291.wav|Famously, though, there was a catch.|93,,
wav48/p335/p335_292.wav|There are so many people to thank.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_293.wav|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_294.wav|He is also a great finisher.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_295.wav|He knew it would cost him millions.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_296.wav|I'd never be free.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_297.wav|Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_298.wav|A counter reaction was.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_299.wav|He said he was sorry.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_300.wav|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_301.wav|Clearly, she says, she would never resort to such devices.|93,,
wav48/p335/p335_302.wav|This will help our confidence.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_303.wav|This looks like it is anything but open.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_304.wav|We are now setting about finding them.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_305.wav|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_306.wav|If not, he should go home.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_307.wav|We must not go down that road.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_308.wav|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_309.wav|Luckily for us, he enjoyed the experience.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_310.wav|I am not among its admirers.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_311.wav|Hitches can be expected.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_312.wav|He wasn't ready to cope with the pressures.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_313.wav|The issues are very intense.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_314.wav|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.|93,,
wav48/p335/p335_315.wav|I feel sorry for the Reds.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_316.wav|The company's in good shape.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_317.wav|Dialogue is the key.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_318.wav|The actors are confident and polished.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_319.wav|They have shown a great desire and attitude.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_320.wav|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_321.wav|Motherwell have no such good fortune.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_322.wav|But he is revelling in the big stage.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_323.wav|And who were they anyway, beforehand?|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_324.wav|You have to think not.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_325.wav|Stock markets will be watching closely.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_326.wav|This is a national crisis.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_327.wav|If they have City backing, what is the influence?|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_328.wav|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_329.wav|In Europe, it is always over two games.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_330.wav|The whole thing would be perfect.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_331.wav|There's a tremendous amount of adventure.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_332.wav|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_333.wav|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_334.wav|However, we had no failures in our side.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_335.wav|I don't have any more contact with Airdrie.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_336.wav|We will be stronger in Berlin.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_337.wav|It is so damaging.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_338.wav|I put pressure on him.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_339.wav|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_340.wav|I'm the one who has to suffer.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_341.wav|With us, we just want them to respond.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_342.wav|He takes his time, and won't be rushed.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_343.wav|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_344.wav|They are the heroes.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_345.wav|The songs are just so good.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_346.wav|We have rebuilt and reformed.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_347.wav|Scottish life can be like this, too.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_348.wav|It was certainly intense.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_349.wav|It was not confirmed by Scotland Yard.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_350.wav|He refused to discuss his imminent retiral.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_351.wav|He denied that taxpayers money was involved.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_352.wav|We were a shambles at the back.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_353.wav|Their condition was described as stable yesterday.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_354.wav|It took more than two years.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_355.wav|There is access for disabled people.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_356.wav|The home was now under new management.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_357.wav|All our thoughts and prayers are with them.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_358.wav|Is my wife a racist?|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_359.wav|It is like a theatre of the absurd.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_360.wav|There is no openness.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_361.wav|It's being very carefully looked at.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_362.wav|It feels like too much.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_363.wav|It was a job he loved.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_364.wav|It may encourage more people to prospect.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_365.wav|But let's not get carried away.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_366.wav|There was some merit in that.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_367.wav|She is believed to be in South Africa.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_368.wav|Its people are inventive, talented and diligent.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_369.wav|This is the last thing we ever expected.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_370.wav|It looks like paradise.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_371.wav|This means a great deal to the families.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_372.wav|At the moment, it is being treated as a tragic accident.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_373.wav|We were short of athletes.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_374.wav|Six other people were injured.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_375.wav|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_376.wav|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_377.wav|Only local people are helping.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_378.wav|There were three boys and two girls.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_379.wav|There's no support for it at all.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_380.wav|Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_381.wav|You're not stopping people using sunbeds.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_382.wav|Writing has diminished in value.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_383.wav|There is a job to be done.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_384.wav|Scotland is too small a country for that.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_385.wav|I am not obsessed with sex.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_386.wav|Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_387.wav|It's our worst nightmare.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_388.wav|I can't believe what has happened.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_389.wav|It's about my time as a guitarist.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_390.wav|It's really nothing new.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_391.wav|You do that because you want to win.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_392.wav|We have been working closely with Holyrood.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_393.wav|From then on, Scott has never looked back.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_394.wav|Partition is not an option.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_395.wav|We have been treated with complete contempt.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_396.wav|I'll tell you honestly.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_397.wav|The home team had an amazing start.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_398.wav|He became the focus of surrounding interest.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_399.wav|It is a comforting fantasy - but it remains a fantasy.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_400.wav|The conclusion is enthralling.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_401.wav|This is usually done by the space shuttle.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_402.wav|The review has been conducted fairly.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_403.wav|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_404.wav|Friends of the family have given their support.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_405.wav|You name it, they have it.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_406.wav|We are obviously disturbed by this case.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_407.wav|There was no cohesion.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_408.wav|There is no going back.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_409.wav|We could play someone else, but he is ready to play.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_410.wav|Courtenay took over on tour.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_411.wav|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.|93,,
wav48/p335/p335_412.wav|The game is now open.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_413.wav|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_414.wav|Jackson may well be right.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_415.wav|I am in a very difficult position.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_416.wav|They will run in tandem with New Work.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_417.wav|THE pain was almost too much to bear.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_418.wav|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_419.wav|He is not very big, either.|93,,,
wav48/p335/p335_420.wav|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.|93,,
wav48/p335/p335_421.wav|But who gets on the tube?|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_422.wav|We are encouraged by the news.|93,,,,
wav48/p335/p335_423.wav|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.|93,,,
wav48/p336/p336_001.wav|Please call Stella.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|94,,
wav48/p336/p336_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|94,,
wav48/p336/p336_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|94,,
wav48/p336/p336_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed forms yellow.|94,,
wav48/p336/p336_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|94,,
wav48/p336/p336_025.wav|I am very happy with the result.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_026.wav|She took them for a term.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_027.wav|It is deeply worrying.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_028.wav|This is a very interesting move.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_029.wav|Are we not men?|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_030.wav|How could it not?|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_031.wav|It is sending the wrong message to people.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_032.wav|Another former manager, Bobby Robson said.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_033.wav|We are proud of them.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_034.wav|We had a really good experience with David.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_035.wav|It was another good idea.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_036.wav|I want to make a vigorous defence.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_037.wav|That incident altered the pattern of the game.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_038.wav|IT is a terrible equation.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_039.wav|That gives us something to kick against.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_040.wav|It was pretty special.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_041.wav|Whatever we are doing, they have good reason to come.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_042.wav|I should say so.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_043.wav|Yet therein is the problem.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_044.wav|This isn't a new problem.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_045.wav|That, though, was just the start of it.|94,,
wav48/p336/p336_046.wav|My office is down there.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_047.wav|There can be no dispute about our history.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_048.wav|The crowd was waiting.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_049.wav|It was a joy.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_050.wav|It's the same with cinema.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_051.wav|It was the climax of the thing.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_052.wav|He died from multiple injuries.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_053.wav|It is nearly there.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_054.wav|I'm going to buy a car.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_055.wav|We said, What do you mean?|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_056.wav|I have been there many times.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_057.wav|The crackdown is launched today by the government.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_058.wav|This ruling is a farce.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_059.wav|They enjoy playing the game.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_060.wav|It was rather a distorted image of Islam.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_061.wav|It is not standing army.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_062.wav|It was a crucial moment.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_063.wav|Someone else has now got them.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_064.wav|The second is freedom.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_065.wav|I let go the telephone and ran.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_066.wav|Get used to it.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_067.wav|For one thing, he was growing far too quickly.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_068.wav|Everyone at the school is delighted for Steven.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_069.wav|After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_070.wav|Sadly, in this case, that was not so.|94,,
wav48/p336/p336_071.wav|The hearing was continued until a later date.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_072.wav|Still, some additions are inspired.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_073.wav|Any error is severely punished.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_074.wav|Yet what is supposed to be said?|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_075.wav|But we will learn from that.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_076.wav|He has not created a Festival resource.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_077.wav|We couldn't afford it.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_078.wav|I get the bus.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_079.wav|I might have been sitting at home, with her out here.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_080.wav|Frankly, we should all have such problems.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_081.wav|The issues are not going to change.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_082.wav|Four minutes later, the show was over.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_083.wav|Would you have ever believed that was possible?|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_084.wav|It will be easier for us.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_085.wav|I don't think it is.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_086.wav|There are no other contenders.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_087.wav|On that they agree.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_088.wav|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_089.wav|But who was driving it?|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_090.wav|We have to get this sorted out.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_091.wav|It was very fast.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_092.wav|Singing is my first love.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_093.wav|When is it ever anything else?|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_094.wav|It's hard to see it.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_095.wav|I believe in trade unions.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_096.wav|Sub Not Used, Mackay.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_097.wav|This is in a league of its own.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_098.wav|The partnership was set up during the summer.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_099.wav|That statement has never been withdrawn.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_100.wav|The supporters gave us a lot of passion.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_101.wav|That is unlikely to happen.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_102.wav|That is a mark of what you are.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_103.wav|This is not finished.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_104.wav|It was one of the firemen.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_105.wav|Now, she has completed a family tradition.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_106.wav|Don't you believe it.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_107.wav|There is another important factor.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_108.wav|Most people know that.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_109.wav|I want to keep playing.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_110.wav|At Westminster, there was disbelief at the news.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_111.wav|The first is in Whitehall, the second in Brussels.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_112.wav|That is how we will be judged.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_113.wav|It's there for people to look at.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_114.wav|We are getting there.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_115.wav|I just couldn't believe what had happened.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_116.wav|They never got into the show this time.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_117.wav|He, too, is keen to redress the balance.|94,,
wav48/p336/p336_118.wav|But no, it's not funny.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_119.wav|We just try to make great records.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_120.wav|It's almost certainly not going to help.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_121.wav|Why does it come out now?|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_122.wav|In that case, the children were not missing.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_123.wav|These figures are truly awful.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_124.wav|The whole thing was just unreal.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_125.wav|They haven't been thought through.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_126.wav|They have their own audience in Edinburgh.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_127.wav|It's better than that, it's fantastic.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_128.wav|The criteria have changed.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_129.wav|Everyone in front of me was dead.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_130.wav|Audacious decisions were taken early on.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_131.wav|I have thought a lot about the Commonwealths.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_132.wav|I just have no maternal instincts.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_133.wav|It has been declared.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_134.wav|His commitment, on the other hand, is clear.|94,,
wav48/p336/p336_135.wav|Clearly, audiences are unsettled.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_136.wav|It's very hard to plan for it.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_137.wav|There is nothing like this back home.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_138.wav|They are declining elsewhere in the UK.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_139.wav|He is that good.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_140.wav|We did not have a clue.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_141.wav|We need to be more specific.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_142.wav|This is the man who provides the hope.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_143.wav|This is a war over our home.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_144.wav|He's got me very well.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_145.wav|He has been banned from the Salmon Inn.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_146.wav|He was always nice to me.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_147.wav|He looked at me before replying.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_148.wav|Then there is the Mini itself.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_149.wav|This may be perfectly innocent.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_150.wav|It's good for the city.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_151.wav|The only answer is a public inquiry.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_152.wav|Controllers major concern is safety.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_153.wav|It's like an extension of your body.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_154.wav|Because he usually is.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_155.wav|It's very simple, no-one is forced to compete.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_156.wav|We have waited a long time for this.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_157.wav|I want my audience to be challenged.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_158.wav|This is the culture change in medicine.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_159.wav|Who do you think you are?|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_160.wav|Parliament was evenly divided on the issue.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_161.wav|I have no battle with the Scots.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_162.wav|I hope he gets it.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_163.wav|Everything has its place and purpose.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_164.wav|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_165.wav|I am here to work for Scottish Labour.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_166.wav|Nobody could survive on that.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_167.wav|I can't do anything before nine.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_168.wav|Their vision was not impeded.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_169.wav|He is married with three children.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_170.wav|These days will be back.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_171.wav|However, they should not come as a surprise.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_172.wav|It could last five months.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_173.wav|Everything is accounted for.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_174.wav|The support from the general public was astounding.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_175.wav|About time too, you might think.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_176.wav|However, it does not tell the full story.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_177.wav|We have made mistakes and were badly punished.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_178.wav|The bombing has had a huge influence.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_179.wav|We've got a mixture of both.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_180.wav|I'm very happy to be here.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_181.wav|This is not the case.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_182.wav|This one was supposed to be so different.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_183.wav|I want the Commonwealth and European titles.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_184.wav|It has been difficult for her to do, he says.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_185.wav|They are now out in the cold.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_186.wav|However, planners should be taking the lead.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_187.wav|Cloning is not ready.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_188.wav|New Labour are running scared.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_189.wav|It is a good result for Great Britain.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_190.wav|The weekly average was three hours.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_191.wav|Is there a new way forward?|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_192.wav|Don't hold your breath!|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_193.wav|This is the start of a slippery slope.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_194.wav|Where do you think she is going?|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_195.wav|Safety is our first concern.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_196.wav|In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_197.wav|Inspections are not the problem.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_198.wav|But who will buy it?|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_199.wav|And it's more subversive.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_200.wav|Openness is always the best way.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_201.wav|It wouldn't go off.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_202.wav|I've been enjoying it, though.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_203.wav|The professor said the results were positive.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_204.wav|I'm trying to be relaxed about the future.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_205.wav|It's part of the end game.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_206.wav|Do they play for the money?|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_207.wav|The train was on time.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_208.wav|So, where do we go from here?|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_209.wav|The claim was denied by the first minister.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_210.wav|More than that, it's a vicious circle.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_211.wav|And how much of a compliment is that?|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_213.wav|Politics is a tough game.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_214.wav|I have friends in Glasgow.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_215.wav|What has changed?|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_216.wav|There's nothing to be gained by it.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_217.wav|Chambers said he would accept the place.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_218.wav|We have been through this with the lawyers.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_219.wav|I'm not interested in the job.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_220.wav|His contract was then not renewed.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_221.wav|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_222.wav|The warnings were a good reminder.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_223.wav|I came here this week to work.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_224.wav|It's the last thing on my mind.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_225.wav|Barry Ferguson is one of them.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_226.wav|The biggest resource is our staff.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_227.wav|We have big ideas.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_228.wav|How will we get there?|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_229.wav|She told me to stop.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_230.wav|I wish him well for the future.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_231.wav|Cars are great for going long distances.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_232.wav|It's not a party, no, no.|94,,
wav48/p336/p336_233.wav|The lads are having a tour.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_234.wav|It may not be life long.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_235.wav|Everyone was in tears.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_236.wav|It was just above the roof.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_237.wav|These were the dreams.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_238.wav|But we must work in harmony.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_239.wav|It's a bit like a bereavement.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_240.wav|There is no other way.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_241.wav|Everyone must be focused on the league.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_242.wav|The English are coming.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_243.wav|You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_244.wav|I believe in theatre.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_245.wav|Only four of his passengers were uninjured.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_246.wav|It's time to say enough is enough.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_247.wav|He has to pull back from the brink.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_248.wav|She has insisted she did nothing wrong.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_249.wav|I don't have any regrets about the edit.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_250.wav|That does not mean we have failed.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_251.wav|The family baton is handed on.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_252.wav|She has a little boy.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_253.wav|Our policy is very clear on this issue.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_254.wav|He has refused to do that.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_255.wav|I can understand why they have gone.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_256.wav|All my training is for Athens.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_257.wav|This is a personal decision for me.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_258.wav|When will you listen?|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_259.wav|I'm happy that we have agreed.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_260.wav|All of them were killed.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_261.wav|All the children on the roll are genuine.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_262.wav|Sub Not Used, McCormick.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_263.wav|You can spend money on housing.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_264.wav|Ferguson must take the blame.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_265.wav|There is no point in denying that.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_266.wav|The kids are paying the price.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_267.wav|Not that it is unique.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_268.wav|We're all going to take a holiday.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_269.wav|I've got three other ideas for the day.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_270.wav|Some injustice was committed.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_271.wav|I've had a wonderful career.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_272.wav|The BBC was a disgrace.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_273.wav|I didn't expect to be in.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_274.wav|The Cabinet is split over the issue.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_275.wav|I reckon he won't make the mistake again.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_276.wav|I should think so, too.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_277.wav|If so, we want to hear from them.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_278.wav|It's not covered by the insurance.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_279.wav|He denied the charge.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_280.wav|I was shaking on the blocks.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_281.wav|There is no easy answer.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_282.wav|I watch the other visitors.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_283.wav|Awareness in Europe of Scotland is high.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_284.wav|I am not a liar.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_285.wav|The cause remained a mystery last night.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_286.wav|He had no problem with alcohol.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_287.wav|I had no experience at all.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_288.wav|Yet he remains confident enough.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_289.wav|It has become very confused.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_290.wav|Fame and money followed.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_291.wav|It's a national sport.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_292.wav|I just made it.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_293.wav|There was no secrecy.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_294.wav|A wide range of restrictions are in place.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_295.wav|Even then it might be difficult.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_296.wav|I can't believe we didn't win that game.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_297.wav|Last night, the extent of the damage was emerging.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_299.wav|Relief was beyond belief.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_300.wav|Beyond that would have been outrageous.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_301.wav|It was complete nonsense.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_302.wav|I seem to keep this for the majors.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_303.wav|It is three years.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_304.wav|They are not always the same person.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_305.wav|We meet again in Berlin.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_306.wav|This is a very special moment for me.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_307.wav|It is a daunting task.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_308.wav|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.|94,,
wav48/p336/p336_309.wav|We have chosen for the patients.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_310.wav|That was me today.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_311.wav|That is when we are really effective.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_312.wav|They just would not have run away.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_313.wav|But this isn't a play about The Troubles.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_314.wav|This idea has been around for four years.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_315.wav|But he made a mistake in picking it.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_316.wav|This is an appealing record.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_317.wav|They are a perfectly good thing in principle.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_318.wav|Only New Zealand has seen a similar increase.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_319.wav|This is a problem we have to tackle.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_320.wav|Yes, it was uplifting.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_321.wav|Nobody should believe this story.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_322.wav|No person has been charged.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_323.wav|One paper was not returned.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_324.wav|I don't want to do too much.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_325.wav|We don't have money to get to town.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_326.wav|We have great support.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_327.wav|One would not want to go there anyway.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_328.wav|And it's difficult to argue.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_329.wav|We'll see what happens.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_330.wav|That could be in place by next year.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_331.wav|That's not part of the deal.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_332.wav|There is a problem.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_333.wav|He pretended not to care.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_334.wav|They are very concerned, and you can understand that.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_335.wav|Not because they want to sing about something.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_336.wav|Was it too obvious?|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_337.wav|Wouldn't it be nice?|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_338.wav|I was in tears in the street.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_339.wav|Eriksson, though, was having none of it.|94,,
wav48/p336/p336_340.wav|It is a terrible thing to have happened.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_343.wav|The work was suspended following the kidnap.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_344.wav|Fifteen minutes later, they were found.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_345.wav|That is why we are here.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_346.wav|He wouldn't do it.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_347.wav|She becomes a mother.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_348.wav|He is very much respected within the group.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_349.wav|People want to learn.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_350.wav|Bomber was not amused.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_351.wav|I am not a happy man.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_352.wav|But it was fun.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_353.wav|Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_354.wav|No decisions have been made in this respect.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_355.wav|It's been such a waste of money.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_356.wav|Not so, it transpires.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_357.wav|Things don't look too good at the moment.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_358.wav|Inside, there is a kind of madness.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_359.wav|I'd like to run.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_360.wav|Its future is no longer in question.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_361.wav|But this relative success has not been easy.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_362.wav|I am a player.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_363.wav|I couldn't quite believe it, and still can't.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_364.wav|He was not alone.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_365.wav|There was too much at stake.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_366.wav|Who wouldn't do it?|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_368.wav|He was taken to hospital, but later died.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_369.wav|Eriksson would have approved.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_370.wav|We are all in the frontline.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_371.wav|It looked like a war zone.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_372.wav|His behaviour today has been disgusting.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_373.wav|Further expansion is possible.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_374.wav|Tyson said he had made a mistake.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_375.wav|I'm interested in all kinds of history.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_376.wav|At this point we can only speculate.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_377.wav|We know we have the quality.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_378.wav|In fact, he should never have been in the field.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_379.wav|It may be the first of many.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_380.wav|It runs in cycles.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_381.wav|It is already making a difference.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_382.wav|I spoke to him yesterday.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_383.wav|We are looking very hard at ourselves.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_384.wav|This is the stuff of live music.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_385.wav|We were beaten by the better team today.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_386.wav|Taxes may need to rise.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_387.wav|It's unusual to say the least.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_388.wav|I was quietly confident about getting the win.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_389.wav|I am not going to sit back.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_390.wav|But this is even worse.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_391.wav|It left me with a sadness.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_392.wav|I was living with my mum.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_393.wav|The truth is he probably doesn't.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_394.wav|There were few surprises.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_395.wav|He is a one-off.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_396.wav|And then he laughs.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_397.wav|She is having an affair with his partner.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_398.wav|He put a lot of effort into it.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_399.wav|The pressure is enormous.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_400.wav|I am not that sadistic.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_401.wav|Are you all right?|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_402.wav|We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_403.wav|I'm certainly thinking about retirement.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_404.wav|But we say Yes - and we are the people.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_405.wav|Is it any good?|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_406.wav|The investment programme will deliver these improvements.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_407.wav|It would be that absurd.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_408.wav|As if he would.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_409.wav|I just carry on with my work.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_410.wav|She made no further comment.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_411.wav|His attacker has been a Rangers fan.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_412.wav|He wants the festival to make a difference.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_413.wav|He didn't know it was his audition, but it was.|94,,,
wav48/p336/p336_415.wav|The auction has seven days to run.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_416.wav|It is easy to be wise in hindsight.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_417.wav|They want to prove a point.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_418.wav|It is my decision and my decision alone.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_419.wav|Would he ever go back to the beginning?|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_420.wav|What is going on?|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_421.wav|Let that be their memorial.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_422.wav|We thought we were looking in good shape.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_423.wav|Tonight is very special.|94,,,,
wav48/p336/p336_424.wav|This is a matter of life and death.|94,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_001.wav|Please call Stella.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a sack for her brother Bob.|95,,
wav48/p339/p339_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|95,,
wav48/p339/p339_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|95,,
wav48/p339/p339_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_018.wav|Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|95,,
wav48/p339/p339_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|95,,
wav48/p339/p339_025.wav|They missed the boat and everyone suffers.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_026.wav|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_027.wav|Glasgow is far from overload.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_028.wav|It's a big mystery.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_029.wav|What is a house without it?|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_030.wav|It was really good in the first week.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_031.wav|It's about the balance.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_032.wav|Like his acting, it was an accident.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_033.wav|It really has not been their season.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_034.wav|I want somebody with something to prove.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_035.wav|This would give Scotland around eight members.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_036.wav|There was a ban on reporting the trial.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_037.wav|I don't think the action was a mistake.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_038.wav|You go in there and do it.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_039.wav|We were in Italy suddenly, we knew.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_040.wav|What will happen to them today?|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_041.wav|I didn't expect to get one.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_042.wav|It was electric, amazing.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_043.wav|I said to him.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_044.wav|Labour has been found out on public spending.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_045.wav|he told a producer.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_046.wav|That is not the place for her.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_047.wav|The jury is still out on this one.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_048.wav|We have to work together.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_049.wav|I don't think that he won't be released.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_050.wav|It is a hard act to follow, the Winning act.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_051.wav|It means it is difficult.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_052.wav|But they were true stories.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_053.wav|I needed to get away.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_054.wav|I will make that point tonight.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_055.wav|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_056.wav|There are two things we have to do.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_057.wav|Are they going to work together again?|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_058.wav|We need to do that every week.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_059.wav|It gives us something to work on.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_060.wav|But what did it matter?|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_061.wav|A government is a government is a government.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_062.wav|Hopefully it will be tomorrow night.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_063.wav|I am not retaining him.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_064.wav|The police are not the target.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_065.wav|It has affected it, obviously.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_066.wav|But that title is a mistake.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_067.wav|And he's not a bigot.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_068.wav|But summer is spent.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_069.wav|Services are being expanded, too.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_070.wav|It has only been rumours.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_071.wav|It is extremely fortunate.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_072.wav|Today is the first step in that process.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_073.wav|Several others were absent.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_074.wav|It is surprising to come back this way.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_075.wav|But there was no time for that.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_076.wav|A review is under way.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_077.wav|That should be fun.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_078.wav|Maybe he will act again.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_079.wav|What we were doing.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_080.wav|What is the Barnett formula?|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_081.wav|It all happened so suddenly.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_082.wav|I won't let that happen.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_083.wav|Or have they?|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_084.wav|There is no change in the strategy.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_085.wav|I had a fortunate war.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_086.wav|It will probably be my last, too.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_087.wav|I am not completely insane.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_088.wav|We spoke about a few people.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_089.wav|She had to learn a new discipline.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_090.wav|In fact, he took it very well.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_091.wav|I decided to take my time.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_092.wav|Quite a lot of people know that, actually.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_093.wav|We did it in one take.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_094.wav|He doesn't even know who he is.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_095.wav|It is hard to understand.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_096.wav|What will it be?|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_097.wav|The search is due to be completed today.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_098.wav|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_099.wav|What you sow, you have to reap.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_100.wav|He is a one-off.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_101.wav|Six men will take the decision.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_102.wav|To have Mr Clinton is quite an accolade.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_103.wav|We should not be surprised at that.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_104.wav|It was a disaster.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_105.wav|We have been so lucky.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_107.wav|It was a bit of a tightrope.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_108.wav|I don't know what we're doing wrong.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_109.wav|It was all over now.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_110.wav|But it was only a matter of time.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_111.wav|I always liked to get a laugh.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_112.wav|I still hope to go.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_113.wav|Sometimes they come off.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_114.wav|We're not that bad.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_115.wav|Today is a victory for the Scottish Parliament.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_116.wav|I feel strongly about it.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_117.wav|There are exciting days ahead.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_118.wav|We have to put this behind us.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_119.wav|I thought it was quite good.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_120.wav|This is a disaster averted for Scotland.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_121.wav|We're very, very happy.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_122.wav|There could be a possible connection.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_123.wav|But there was everything!|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_124.wav|We are doing very well as we are.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_125.wav|The Scots are great.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_126.wav|That imbalance was evident in their play.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_127.wav|However, the drama was not over.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_128.wav|But it was not just the land.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_129.wav|I don't think the referees are against us.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_130.wav|It is too much for me.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_131.wav|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_132.wav|We are still waiting.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_133.wav|It happened again yesterday.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_134.wav|He will be a major challenger next year.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_135.wav|That question was never asked.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_136.wav|I am not inclined to believe it.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_137.wav|It was on fire.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_138.wav|I have fallen in love with the Highlands.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_139.wav|How can they tell?|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_140.wav|My ambition is to make the cut.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_141.wav|It will be for the committee to decide.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_142.wav|Their conditions are described as serious but stable.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_143.wav|Rangers must be winners, it says.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_144.wav|He was part of the family.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_145.wav|I certainly think it should be there.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_146.wav|But it does not matter.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_147.wav|Hopefully we can put in a performance.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_148.wav|Sadly, he has a point.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_149.wav|It was so sad.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_150.wav|Mind you, all was not lost.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_151.wav|We were extremely lucky.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_152.wav|It was an amazing time.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_153.wav|In fact, the reasons are simple.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_154.wav|The hearing is expected to continue today.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_155.wav|It is just a matter of time.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_156.wav|This news is really depressing.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_157.wav|I'm not fit for anything else.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_158.wav|The day may come, but not for a while.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_159.wav|The enemy was time.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_160.wav|He would have done the same to me.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_161.wav|What were they told?|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_162.wav|More cases are expected.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_163.wav|I believe the gap is nearly there.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_164.wav|It would be very dangerous.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_165.wav|How can they say that?|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_166.wav|My condition is not bad.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_167.wav|Tomorrow is a big day for Scotland.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_168.wav|I would like to make an impact, of course.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_169.wav|I am confident of the outcome this week.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_170.wav|The goal is clear.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_171.wav|Just think about the lines.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_172.wav|It all depends on the wind.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_173.wav|I was very influenced by him.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_174.wav|I'm so worried about the roads.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_175.wav|This was much worse.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_176.wav|This was certainly not about money.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_177.wav|It is simple, but profound.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_178.wav|The funding is now there.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_179.wav|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_180.wav|A film is different from a book.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_181.wav|Within three days he was dead.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_182.wav|You'll find out on Saturday.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_183.wav|Did they give any good advice?|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_184.wav|We know that from recent experience.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_185.wav|From day one, we were a family.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_186.wav|It separates the men from the boys.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_187.wav|This could be wonderful.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_188.wav|He loved it, and so did they.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_189.wav|The other was a football match.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_190.wav|They have the players to do it.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_191.wav|Which is worse?|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_192.wav|He has made a step forward.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_193.wav|That was very important.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_194.wav|This will have to change.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_195.wav|First, the programme was unbalanced.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_196.wav|It was a very strong metaphor.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_197.wav|We are going to have a party.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_198.wav|I have no problem with that.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_199.wav|The Parliament will make its own decisions.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_200.wav|I'm very happy that it exploded.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_201.wav|We're all paying for it.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_202.wav|Lester was like that.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_203.wav|Look at New Labour, it hasn't worked.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_204.wav|That's a matter for them.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_205.wav|We were never told it was already decided.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_206.wav|It is part of our heritage.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_207.wav|It is not a road of life.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_208.wav|It is not as simple as that.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_209.wav|Everything in the symphony is there.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_210.wav|Find them somebody they deserve.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_211.wav|It's a big challenge for the audience.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_212.wav|If that's the case, he will struggle.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_213.wav|It has certainly paid off for him.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_214.wav|We're not getting involved.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_215.wav|The lottery has helped.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_216.wav|They know the language.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_217.wav|The acting left a lot to be desired.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_218.wav|We shall be victorious.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_219.wav|The quality of work is very impressive.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_220.wav|However, he added there were signs of progress.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_221.wav|You cannot do that in a lobby.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_222.wav|We will all suffer as a result.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_223.wav|Without doubt, they can win the title.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_224.wav|What's it about?|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_225.wav|We are looking to the future.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_226.wav|The signs are positive.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_227.wav|I called it right.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_228.wav|I see it as my job.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_229.wav|I have always believed in myself.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_230.wav|It has to be put in context.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_231.wav|I think we can get there.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_232.wav|I think the Scottish bid is very strong.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_233.wav|No, they have played well.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_234.wav|The reaction of staff has been fantastic.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_235.wav|The answer is obviously no.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_236.wav|I'll take it as it comes.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_237.wav|I think we're the better side.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_238.wav|We act because we must.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_239.wav|There are two mysteries.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_240.wav|The teacher would have approved.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_241.wav|Are you going to win?|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_242.wav|We didn't get the supply to the forwards.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_243.wav|I could have been killed on that day.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_244.wav|They have to come up with a solution.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_245.wav|It is very enjoyable.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_246.wav|Now, that would impress the kids.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_247.wav|Did it work?|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_248.wav|But that is for another day.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_249.wav|There is a great carry over value.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_250.wav|It was not like that at all.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_251.wav|Police are appealing for witnesses.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_252.wav|I was very surprised.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_253.wav|We all knew they could do it.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_254.wav|It's about taking risks.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_255.wav|Why is this?|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_256.wav|He is due in Israel tomorrow.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_257.wav|It was indeed a night to remember.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_258.wav|There are not too many like him.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_259.wav|The memory is there.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_260.wav|It was an amazing experience.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_261.wav|Nobody has been put on trial.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_262.wav|He will go on the bench.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_263.wav|The police are hopeless.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_264.wav|There are no plans to change this.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_265.wav|We are deeply concerned at the announcement.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_266.wav|A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_267.wav|That's the important thing.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_268.wav|Should he resign?|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_269.wav|They have to live with the risk.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_270.wav|It is, but that's not the point.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_271.wav|It was my whole life.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_272.wav|It was a classic.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_273.wav|This week is a perfect example.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_274.wav|However, it is going to happen.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_275.wav|This time it really could happen.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_276.wav|That sort of thing is long gone.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_277.wav|That includes the equipment?|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_278.wav|It does nothing for me.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_279.wav|That has been lost.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_280.wav|But that's another story.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_281.wav|I think it has worked.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_282.wav|No other family members could be contacted.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_283.wav|There is nothing to be gained from that.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_284.wav|We're very proud of him and his achievement.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_285.wav|But do not rely on it.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_286.wav|I made a mistake.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_287.wav|What do you want.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_288.wav|That prevented any recurrence of the problem.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_289.wav|I think we could do well in Europe.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_290.wav|And yet, there has been no great impact.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_291.wav|Was that not awful?|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_292.wav|Yesterday was a statement of intent.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_293.wav|I'm not there yet but it is close.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_294.wav|But it will not work again.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_295.wav|Even then he wanted to deflect attention.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_296.wav|I have nothing to say on that.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_297.wav|The rest is his own.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_298.wav|I have no worry about that.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_299.wav|There has been a fair bit in between, too.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_300.wav|Who was on the panel?|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_301.wav|It turned out to have been three hours.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_302.wav|That is exactly right.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_303.wav|That is not good for golf!|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_304.wav|He had planned to sell it.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_305.wav|We know the goals will come.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_306.wav|But it did not last.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_307.wav|They need to look after themselves.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_308.wav|They will be stopped, and they will be punished.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_309.wav|She asked for the appointment with me.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_310.wav|We have nothing to lose.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_311.wav|The first time it was rejected.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_312.wav|He did not report it.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_313.wav|No-one can take it in.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_314.wav|They were following his orders.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_315.wav|That is an entirely different discipline.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_316.wav|It was an insult.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_317.wav|Yet there is hope.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_318.wav|Referees in Scotland are very weak.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_319.wav|It will not be easy for him.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_320.wav|That was a fairy tale.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_321.wav|I would love to do that.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_322.wav|You'll have to wait and see.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_323.wav|It wasn't the issue.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_324.wav|The number never came.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_325.wav|I really have to go now.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_326.wav|We are going to listen to Britain.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_327.wav|There isn't much of a scene in Austria.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_328.wav|Words are not enough.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_329.wav|He is in charge on the pitch.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_330.wav|We have expected it.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_331.wav|Mr Blair was ready for him.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_332.wav|Well, that was the plan.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_333.wav|The problem is fairly serious.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_334.wav|No decisions have been taken.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_335.wav|We won't do that.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_336.wav|It's the body that counts.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_337.wav|Sprinters are not fit.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_338.wav|This has been coming for weeks and weeks.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_339.wav|It's a double whammy.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_340.wav|Charges against the pair were found not proven.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_341.wav|Let's not make that mistake again.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_342.wav|That's why he is the prime minister.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_343.wav|Only injury has prevented that happening before.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_344.wav|They have to be dealt with.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_345.wav|His manager blamed the referee.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_346.wav|So what was he really doing?|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_347.wav|I don't want to go anywhere.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_348.wav|How do we get a bigger stage?|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_349.wav|We're very close to being a good team.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_350.wav|I thought their commitment was superb.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_351.wav|That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_352.wav|My mind is the most important thing now.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_353.wav|I had nothing to lose.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_354.wav|This is a really serious issue.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_355.wav|I thought to myself.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_356.wav|Could it be?|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_357.wav|We're talking to the US.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_358.wav|Thereafter they were again in control.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_359.wav|It looks as though there is no chance.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_360.wav|You have to keep the focus alive.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_361.wav|It could have been a ceilidh.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_362.wav|I cannot really commit.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_363.wav|There are many questions to be answered.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_364.wav|Sadly, so did a couple of errors.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_365.wav|This is a new beginning.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_366.wav|There are moments of honesty, too.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_367.wav|They will fight for everything.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_368.wav|He is doing just that.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_369.wav|The night is young.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_370.wav|But there are signs of a revival.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_371.wav|I thought it was a great game.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_372.wav|Just get on with it.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_373.wav|Germany also said it was unimpressed.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_374.wav|It shows the Government is listening.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_375.wav|She's the runner - she makes the decisions.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_376.wav|They want it to work.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_377.wav|This is a completely new experience for me.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_378.wav|They still have a great sense of humour.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_379.wav|It decided to blame the media.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_380.wav|We have chosen for the patients.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_381.wav|He was at the outset of his career.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_382.wav|Our position is quite clear.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_383.wav|It could now be up to the courts.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_384.wav|We can make a difference.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_385.wav|This was not a contest.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_386.wav|So far the weather has been very pleasant.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_387.wav|Breaching that condition was itself an offence.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_388.wav|I cannot describe it.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_389.wav|It is not designed to kill.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_390.wav|He has run a hell of a race.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_391.wav|We'll have to be satisfied with it.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_392.wav|Gordon Brown did not inherit a mess.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_393.wav|It is good football in Scotland.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_394.wav|There is no other option.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_395.wav|You can feel the tension in the air.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_396.wav|It is a technique.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_397.wav|Is it the shape of things to come?|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_398.wav|My body is exhausted.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_399.wav|It is about more than Scotland.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_400.wav|It's not just going to be busy.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_401.wav|She was on the edge of breaking point.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_402.wav|The first appeared to be successful.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_403.wav|She was so supportive.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_404.wav|I'm delighted with our performance.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_405.wav|We await a decision.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_406.wav|It's a matter of balance.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_407.wav|It is an investment in our product.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_408.wav|Everyone can have their opinion.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_409.wav|What would you ask?|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_410.wav|We have got to deal with it.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_411.wav|Where do we spend it?|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_412.wav|I don't know how she does it.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_413.wav|I saw it later in the news.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_414.wav|Now we must look to the future.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_415.wav|I didn't play badly.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_416.wav|We haven't come out of this very well.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_417.wav|They are looking for partners.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_418.wav|I thought they could have made the gesture.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_419.wav|We should have been rewarded for producing.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_420.wav|I am also delighted for all the players.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_421.wav|He did very well, but didn't win.|95,,,
wav48/p339/p339_422.wav|There is no shortage of questions.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_423.wav|Couldn't see the point.|95,,,,
wav48/p339/p339_424.wav|Which, in effect, it is.|95,,
wav48/p340/p340_001.wav|Please call Stella.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|96,,
wav48/p340/p340_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes the raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|96,,
wav48/p340/p340_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|96,,
wav48/p340/p340_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_017.wav|Others have tried to explain this phenomenon physically.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|96,,
wav48/p340/p340_025.wav|It would be nice.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_026.wav|We are not prepared to do that.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_027.wav|We've just decided to do something about it.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_028.wav|It's a horrific incident.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_029.wav|But it's not just about that.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_030.wav|We've not won anything yet.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_031.wav|He was very close.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_032.wav|But someone has to take them.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_033.wav|We don't find any danger from them.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_034.wav|Do you think they would do any better?|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_035.wav|They were appalling, disgraceful.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_036.wav|Who was that?|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_037.wav|There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_038.wav|This is my personal assessment.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_039.wav|It is a recipe for success.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_040.wav|You've got to have everything inside with you.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_041.wav|We didn't deserve to win.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_042.wav|This is great news.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_043.wav|We can hardly talk about it.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_044.wav|That was a month ago.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_045.wav|I have lost all confidence.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_046.wav|It would be another reason to live.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_047.wav|I felt under a lot of pressure.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_048.wav|None of the pieces was commissioned.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_049.wav|It is somewhere to be.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_050.wav|But it was no problem.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_051.wav|This has been a difficult time for me.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_052.wav|These people are not big names.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_053.wav|Don't you believe it.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_054.wav|I certainly think it's very short-sighted.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_055.wav|We did something about it.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_056.wav|Where is the money coming from?|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_057.wav|It needs a rethink.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_058.wav|Why does it work?|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_059.wav|He would have been wrong.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_060.wav|He played really, really well.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_061.wav|He was right of course.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_062.wav|It's there for people to look at.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_063.wav|Together, we can make a difference.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_064.wav|That, however, was the exception.|96,,
wav48/p340/p340_065.wav|This has been a long process.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_066.wav|It's a lovely, lovely film.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_067.wav|It's probably just as well.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_068.wav|It is time for the talking to stop.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_069.wav|We were very close.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_070.wav|If only it were so.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_071.wav|They do not deliver.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_072.wav|However, that is just for starters.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_073.wav|This can be extreme.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_074.wav|I'm sure that they will learn.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_075.wav|Would she remember the music?|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_076.wav|There was still more disquiet in Israel.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_077.wav|Two options are being proposed.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_078.wav|Mr Masterton said he was very hopeful.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_079.wav|He is now back in Britain.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_080.wav|There was no commission.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_081.wav|There was a vacuum.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_082.wav|It is time to be realistic.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_083.wav|Everyone in front of me was dead.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_084.wav|Willie deserved it, for what he has achieved.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_085.wav|It is a potential danger.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_086.wav|I've thought a lot about the Commonwealths.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_087.wav|But we never wanted to do that here.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_088.wav|There was no hint of scandal.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_089.wav|The money will go straight to the headteacher.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_090.wav|He said, we're delighted by the vote.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_091.wav|It could be to do with the location.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_092.wav|This is a terrible tragedy.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_093.wav|The teenager had been missing for six months.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_094.wav|I'm delighted to be coming back home.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_095.wav|He said he never saw it.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_096.wav|It is a matter of clarity.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_097.wav|You will never get a conviction.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_098.wav|He did not have to stop and think.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_099.wav|We deserved to win it.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_100.wav|Or did it?|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_101.wav|It's just not funny!|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_102.wav|His own excitement is never difficult to detect.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_103.wav|He almost admitted as much.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_104.wav|So what is the problem?|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_105.wav|We believe it to be completely without merit.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_106.wav|He didn't bother a soul.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_107.wav|That was my first reaction.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_108.wav|Fishing is a declining industry.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_109.wav|Another man said, It was horrible.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_110.wav|That's the way it goes.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_111.wav|But we still don't know.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_112.wav|Are there any he wants to play?|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_113.wav|The film is on a tightrope.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_114.wav|It was a question of patience.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_115.wav|I have never been in anything like that.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_116.wav|I have done ever since it was published.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_117.wav|We have got to the top.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_118.wav|In fact, they have the opposite effect.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_119.wav|And it worked, so we kept it.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_120.wav|The king is delighted by the honour.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_121.wav|Johnsen is equally concerned.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_122.wav|My body is clearly capable.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_123.wav|Yes, we can beat them.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_124.wav|She was not hard done by.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_125.wav|They said they were only young men.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_126.wav|We are in the end game.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_127.wav|This is not the case.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_128.wav|There may be some resistance.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_129.wav|It is the same old story.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_130.wav|You need that freedom in society.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_131.wav|It is a strong case.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_132.wav|Who do you think will win?|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_133.wav|I certainly would not accept this decision.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_134.wav|That was one very hard game.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_135.wav|He said something in his work.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_136.wav|I recommend a tour.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_137.wav|This research is extremely promising.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_138.wav|I was invited to work in Germany.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_139.wav|Weather conditions were good, he added.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_140.wav|Don't hold your breath.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_141.wav|He was shaking like a leaf.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_142.wav|I have a moral dilemma.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_143.wav|It looks like a hit.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_144.wav|How did he know?|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_145.wav|He will have to live with his words.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_146.wav|Openness is always the best way.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_147.wav|It added to the spectacle.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_148.wav|They are working very well.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_149.wav|And he listens to his artists as well.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_150.wav|He is advised that he has done so.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_151.wav|Annika is very, very fit.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_152.wav|This is not quite right.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_153.wav|It really is tremendous.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_154.wav|I've never regretted my decision.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_155.wav|This is a recipe for disaster.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_156.wav|The wind was coming from all directions.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_157.wav|So we started building a home.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_158.wav|He was as good as his word.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_159.wav|It will not happen overnight.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_160.wav|Surely it can't get any worse.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_161.wav|He has to learn.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_162.wav|He, too, will return.|96,,
wav48/p340/p340_163.wav|What then is wrong?|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_164.wav|My brother is not like that.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_165.wav|He was very fit.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_166.wav|It was very exciting.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_167.wav|It is clear that change is required.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_168.wav|They did a very good job.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_169.wav|It has been a waste of time.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_170.wav|As far as we're concerned, the matter is closed.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_171.wav|He had no previous convictions.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_172.wav|It is no more than a shell.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_173.wav|And did they have sex?|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_174.wav|But he was a really nice man.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_175.wav|It was very close.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_176.wav|It should be scrapped.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_177.wav|It gives us hope.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_178.wav|We can't determine that clearly.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_179.wav|They are just trying to cover up.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_180.wav|Are you the man from The Herald?|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_181.wav|And that's it?|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_182.wav|I came here this week to work.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_183.wav|We are really good friends.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_184.wav|But that is not an issue for now.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_185.wav|Of course the ending was fantastic.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_186.wav|I want to be frank.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_187.wav|This was an option from the beginning.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_188.wav|Clearly he is keeping in touch.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_189.wav|Yet it seemed to work.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_190.wav|I think it was just a tragic accident.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_191.wav|We haven't been able to go and see.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_192.wav|It works, as well.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_193.wav|I can't say anything.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_194.wav|I would be interested in another attempt.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_195.wav|However, that is a sizeable if.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_196.wav|There is no other way.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_197.wav|This was all well and good.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_198.wav|This is a disaster for us.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_199.wav|What does that mean?|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_200.wav|This is your life.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_201.wav|He has seen the past.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_202.wav|He can be beaten.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_203.wav|He had been on holiday visiting his grandmother.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_204.wav|Why does he do it?|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_205.wav|That's my daughter acting.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_206.wav|They are very clever and very dangerous.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_207.wav|It wouldn't matter if he had.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_208.wav|We lost out a little bit.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_209.wav|Hollywood comedy is having a good week.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_210.wav|I had just taken it off.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_211.wav|The family baton is handed on.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_212.wav|We have to put pressure on Rangers.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_213.wav|It was properly reported to us.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_214.wav|He was outstanding today - the best player on the park.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_215.wav|The seller was not revealed.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_216.wav|Everything happened so quickly.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_217.wav|How can this be?|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_218.wav|I am feeling a bit better.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_219.wav|Everyone here is heartbroken.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_220.wav|Not so, it seems.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_221.wav|He was also a great man.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_222.wav|We have no further comment to make.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_223.wav|This produces exactly the opposite effect.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_224.wav|Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_225.wav|You have to keep it on the fairways.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_226.wav|Sub Not Used, McCormick.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_227.wav|So there, we won.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_228.wav|I don't like to fail.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_229.wav|I really didn't think he would.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_230.wav|He may have a long wait.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_231.wav|They have already done that.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_232.wav|Later, a very different story emerged.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_233.wav|So it should be.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_234.wav|They didn't find any substance.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_235.wav|It's hard to say.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_236.wav|Her heart was not in it.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_237.wav|After all, he is the King of Scotland.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_238.wav|Is there any prospect of this happening?|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_239.wav|They are now collapsing.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_240.wav|He had been surprised by the local reaction.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_241.wav|Government funding is not a problem.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_242.wav|I'm still an amateur in that sense.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_243.wav|We just did not want to believe it.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_244.wav|The medal itself is not that important.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_245.wav|I should think so, too.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_246.wav|The time for change is now.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_247.wav|They deserved to beat us in the replay.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_248.wav|Can they be serious?|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_249.wav|We've got to get this right.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_250.wav|The film was great.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_251.wav|I'm just enjoying every match.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_252.wav|They set up to win the hole.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_253.wav|I am not a liar.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_254.wav|Let's make this clear.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_255.wav|We also hope to meet the men.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_256.wav|It was quite simply, delicious.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_257.wav|I can't believe it happened.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_258.wav|Thankfully it was cleared up.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_259.wav|The game will be at a football stadium.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_260.wav|They were his words.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_261.wav|Shelter also supports the reform.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_262.wav|The attack was totally out of the blue.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_263.wav|People were very confused.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_264.wav|We've had a lot of adjusting to do.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_265.wav|I am very relieved.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_266.wav|The people have been really friendly.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_267.wav|It was bound to happen, and it has happened.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_268.wav|Aberdeen were difficult to break down.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_269.wav|That, though, is not true.|96,,
wav48/p340/p340_270.wav|I hope he comes back.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_271.wav|They made up for it on Saturday.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_272.wav|That was our mission.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_273.wav|I am delighted for them.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_274.wav|The second half was a different affair.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_275.wav|The scheme has been funded by the Government.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_276.wav|They might be surprised by the response.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_277.wav|I've done it all.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_278.wav|We have worked well with them for years.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_279.wav|They've had a good start as well.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_280.wav|The director's a genius.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_281.wav|One thing is clear.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_282.wav|We might never see him again.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_283.wav|Such as it is.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_284.wav|The car was just there.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_285.wav|They were very unfair to him.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_286.wav|I have spoken to my brother.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_287.wav|And that is very good indeed.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_288.wav|We could have had no new money.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_289.wav|It wasn't an easy decision.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_290.wav|It wasn't really like that at all.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_291.wav|What will happen to them now?|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_292.wav|It is set in Paris.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_293.wav|The Dream is as hard as they come.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_294.wav|We are not collecting.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_295.wav|It shows the right amount of progress.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_296.wav|I thought the dancing was over.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_297.wav|I think they have got it completely right.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_298.wav|This is excellent news for Glasgow.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_299.wav|He's already made history.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_300.wav|Police have appealed for witnesses.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_301.wav|There is a lot of fear.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_302.wav|They are not left wing.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_303.wav|I've heard it all before.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_304.wav|We are not there yet.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_305.wav|We will not give up on the truth.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_306.wav|Sub Not Used, McCall.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_307.wav|Now they had it.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_308.wav|She died a few days later.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_309.wav|What is their concern?|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_310.wav|The difference was amazing.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_311.wav|That is why we are here.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_312.wav|But it is historic.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_313.wav|You have to feel for the guy.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_314.wav|I have still to hear about that.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_315.wav|I'm going to win the next two.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_316.wav|You know it was good fun.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_317.wav|They want that school.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_318.wav|They have not changed at all.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_319.wav|One is investment, one is reform.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_320.wav|The last few weeks have been really bad.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_321.wav|Structural changes will never be enough.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_322.wav|I am extremely cautious.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_323.wav|That was always the danger.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_324.wav|Will they fall in love?|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_325.wav|There was nothing sinister in that.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_326.wav|But don't just take my word for it.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_327.wav|Is that what it's about?|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_328.wav|And the audience is a surprise.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_329.wav|They worked on it for three hours.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_330.wav|Let's make him a show.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_331.wav|I'd never heard anything like it before.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_332.wav|People are using it in their daily lives.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_333.wav|It seemed so personal.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_334.wav|Would that be for men and women?|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_335.wav|The government agreed to pay.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_336.wav|I think we have got the balance right.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_337.wav|It was a very terrible thing.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_338.wav|Let's not take too much for granted.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_339.wav|It has been an extremely long haul.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_340.wav|I'll need to discuss it with my family.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_341.wav|She is deeply distressed.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_342.wav|They should have listened to me.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_343.wav|Well, there can be no complaints about this one.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_344.wav|They said they would.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_345.wav|When will this change?|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_346.wav|You know the score.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_347.wav|It was like someone had died.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_348.wav|I am an innocent man.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_349.wav|The improvement today was fantastic.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_350.wav|He has been under great pressure.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_351.wav|I'm looking forward to coming home.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_352.wav|She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_353.wav|Our Great Depression is our lives.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_354.wav|He was elected as a councillor last year.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_355.wav|I just did not cope with the pressure.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_356.wav|But he did not appear.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_357.wav|So he was anxious to try something new.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_358.wav|The time was right.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_359.wav|It all happened so quickly.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_360.wav|It is working well.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_361.wav|They really want to do it.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_362.wav|He said nothing of the sort.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_363.wav|Governments will have to respond.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_364.wav|It simply doesn't happen.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_365.wav|We wanted to do something different.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_366.wav|The past is history, not destiny.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_367.wav|I love it here.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_368.wav|Things are on track.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_369.wav|Frankly it was disgusting.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_370.wav|It is a tragedy for the area.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_371.wav|He was not entirely correct.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_372.wav|I'm sorry if any offence has been caused.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_373.wav|War is not the action.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_374.wav|There are not enough of them.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_375.wav|It has been a frustrating one.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_376.wav|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_377.wav|But we wouldn't want them any other way.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_378.wav|What's in a name?|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_379.wav|It feels like a winner already.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_380.wav|They are expected to be released today.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_381.wav|There was no question of him not impressing.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_382.wav|We were all afraid.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_383.wav|I hadn't had that before.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_384.wav|We have a plan in place.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_385.wav|That is to miss the point.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_386.wav|It will be a new experience.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_387.wav|I didn't see it.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_388.wav|Scotland has lost a great religious leader.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_389.wav|IT had to happen.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_390.wav|It is a challenge for all of us.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_391.wav|The children are fine.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_392.wav|I don't believe in God.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_393.wav|There's also the point.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_394.wav|It's good to be back.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_395.wav|It wasn't the second one.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_396.wav|He got his degree.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_397.wav|And rugby fans can help.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_398.wav|Detectives are still working on the case.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_399.wav|I reported it but nothing was done.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_400.wav|They were not defeated.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_401.wav|There was much to be positive about.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_402.wav|It wants them to go home.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_403.wav|I had a ball today.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_404.wav|Yet the improvement in behaviour was huge.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_405.wav|He said no survivors had been found.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_406.wav|It is the end of an era.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_407.wav|We shall not do that.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_408.wav|My daughter was really, really innocent.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_409.wav|It will not be easy.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_410.wav|Once again, he refused.|96,,,
wav48/p340/p340_411.wav|And it will be a challenge.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_412.wav|And Scotland is no different.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_413.wav|The power of religion is so strong.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_414.wav|It means a huge amount.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_415.wav|There are two interests in this woodland.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_416.wav|I was frustrated here.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_417.wav|It is a good result.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_418.wav|Are you watching Liverpool?|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_419.wav|I'll never think of myself as a star.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_420.wav|It was one New Year.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_421.wav|We made a world record together.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_422.wav|Our policy is already working well.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_423.wav|I believe we have a good chance.|96,,,,
wav48/p340/p340_424.wav|Things were not easy from the outset.|96,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_001.wav|Please call Stella.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|97,,
wav48/p341/p341_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|97,,
wav48/p341/p341_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|97,,
wav48/p341/p341_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|97,,
wav48/p341/p341_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|97,,
wav48/p341/p341_025.wav|This guy is never going to give up.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_026.wav|That's interesting to me.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_027.wav|I managed to take her completely by surprise.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_028.wav|It is only one night, after all.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_029.wav|The injuries are not too serious.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_030.wav|Gilbert was not amused.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_031.wav|I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_032.wav|It has moved on in the last week.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_033.wav|Everything was up for grabs.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_034.wav|It's easy to see why.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_035.wav|I am proud of moments like that.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_036.wav|That was no surprise to me.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_037.wav|This has been blown out of all proportion.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_038.wav|There is no escape.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_039.wav|It's wonderful to have won.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_040.wav|Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_041.wav|He was arrested, but later released without charge.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_042.wav|I fell into it by accident.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_043.wav|Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_044.wav|This is a big advantage.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_045.wav|Her daughter is getting married.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_046.wav|Moray Council could not be contacted last night.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_047.wav|If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_048.wav|All the lads are totally focused on that.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_049.wav|Today is not about contracts.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_050.wav|That says something for his strength of character.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_051.wav|We are going for it.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_052.wav|You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_053.wav|It's to do with play.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_054.wav|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_055.wav|I've just got to do this.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_056.wav|It's not, of course, a concert hall.|97,,
wav48/p341/p341_057.wav|So the process was refined.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_058.wav|Labour accused the Tory leader of panicking.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_059.wav|I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_060.wav|I think it is a sensible change.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_061.wav|Sex is fun?|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_062.wav|They were not doing it too well, either.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_063.wav|He added, It's not a racial problem.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_064.wav|This is the crossroads.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_065.wav|He had played well in that central role.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_066.wav|He is pretty upset.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_067.wav|And who would argue with that?|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_068.wav|Where is the human rights?|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_069.wav|We must put a marker down.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_070.wav|The decision is an absolute disgrace.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_071.wav|Now, just two games into the season, he has gone.|97,,
wav48/p341/p341_072.wav|It is time to give her a rest.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_073.wav|They had had time for little else.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_074.wav|The feeling is awesome.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_075.wav|We have reports of this throughout Scotland.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_076.wav|But there was a shift.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_077.wav|The settlement could run to millions.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_078.wav|It does not stop at the border.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_079.wav|We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_080.wav|He released a half-dozen solo albums.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_081.wav|Robert is a special talent.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_082.wav|John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint.|97,,
wav48/p341/p341_083.wav|In the meantime, he added, prevention was the key.|97,,
wav48/p341/p341_084.wav|They are going to carry it through.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_085.wav|She added, It is a huge problem.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_086.wav|You can't keep them separate.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_087.wav|The composer therefore believes he can do it.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_088.wav|I still feel like a wee boy.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_089.wav|He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_090.wav|The feedback from audiences was just so positive.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_091.wav|It had a gigantic effect.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_092.wav|Israel has done very little until now.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_093.wav|Debate was impassioned and furious.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_094.wav|We are losing this war.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_095.wav|It's a difficult one to play.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_096.wav|The death rates are still as high.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_097.wav|We are seeing a Government in a hurry.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_098.wav|It is a great honour and a privilege.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_099.wav|We certainly will need to watch him.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_100.wav|I don't think it could be clearer.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_101.wav|That meant the search was unlawful.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_102.wav|He put some colour into Scottish history.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_103.wav|People buy everything with cash.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_104.wav|We are trying to establish a date.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_105.wav|He is a law unto himself.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_106.wav|The website is now being amended.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_107.wav|There was great support all round the route.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_108.wav|I was a bit nervous.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_109.wav|It was a bit of a struggle today.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_110.wav|It was love of Helen and the children.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_111.wav|If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_112.wav|I love this tournament.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_113.wav|This is thought to mean sometime next week.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_114.wav|He had a heart problem.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_115.wav|The breakdown was much later in her life.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_116.wav|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_117.wav|Both managements are very supportive.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_118.wav|Whoever said that cannot have seen it.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_119.wav|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.|97,,
wav48/p341/p341_120.wav|The choice is strictly personal.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_121.wav|We are going to go about our lives.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_122.wav|He had other things on his mind.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_123.wav|The lady is right.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_124.wav|I hadn't seen them in eight years.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_125.wav|Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.|97,,
wav48/p341/p341_126.wav|The next few months will tell.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_127.wav|I'm so proud of my team.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_128.wav|It is crucial for both teams.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_129.wav|It ended as it began, in confusion.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_130.wav|I am now just a bit uneasy.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_131.wav|You can see their point.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_132.wav|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_133.wav|There was no hint of bravado.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_134.wav|However, in Scotland this figure was four weeks.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_135.wav|Yet he chose to do something different.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_136.wav|He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy.|97,,
wav48/p341/p341_137.wav|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_138.wav|There were no casualties.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_139.wav|The case will now go to appeal.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_140.wav|They really did a great job.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_141.wav|A teacher is, really, about unity.|97,,
wav48/p341/p341_142.wav|They are still going to be impulsive.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_143.wav|I love you so very much.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_144.wav|He is a very nice man.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_145.wav|The road was closed for several hours.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_146.wav|Their condition was described as stable.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_147.wav|There's a good chance of seeing something.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_148.wav|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_149.wav|I had a tie in my hand.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_150.wav|Surrey police said no body had been found.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_151.wav|Sean Connery did not disappoint.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_152.wav|Such a city does not exist.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_153.wav|My aim is a top six finish.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_154.wav|He came in an army uniform.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_155.wav|We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_156.wav|It was to no avail.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_157.wav|Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_158.wav|But my heart is in athletics.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_159.wav|That is in the very nature of farming.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_160.wav|You shouldn't have a stoppage in November.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_161.wav|These matters are now behind us.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_162.wav|I'm working on that.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_163.wav|I love the tradition of vaudeville.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_164.wav|It was then into overtime.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_165.wav|Most of the public are behind me.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_166.wav|The first eviction takes place on Sunday.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_167.wav|It really is a gift to the world.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_168.wav|Look at his last couple of records.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_169.wav|I am still very much a director.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_170.wav|We must not give in to bastards.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_171.wav|She may even appear in some more films.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_172.wav|In some cases, the nation should be grateful.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_173.wav|My house was shaking at the time.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_174.wav|They will know they deserve to be there.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_175.wav|Of course he is.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_176.wav|This is a very positive step forward.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_177.wav|This is a huge confidence boost.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_178.wav|They recorded their debut album in New York.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_179.wav|And does it?|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_180.wav|The crackdown is launched today by the government.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_181.wav|That's how it worked in Bosnia.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_182.wav|Nobody ever knew it had happened.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_183.wav|She is a very lucky lady.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_184.wav|It's the whole season.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_185.wav|We've been there for seven years.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_186.wav|Promises were not kept.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_187.wav|His signature is his handwriting.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_188.wav|He admitted there were two aspects of fear.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_189.wav|I've already done that.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_190.wav|We are on the path of change.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_191.wav|You can feel at home in China.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_192.wav|Who is he?|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_193.wav|It has to be a long-term commitment.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_194.wav|No such remedy has ever been pursued.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_195.wav|Felt good about it.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_196.wav|It also highlighted some local hero districts.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_197.wav|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_198.wav|Why does she suddenly win everything now?|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_199.wav|What's the big idea?|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_200.wav|One season, they might do well.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_201.wav|It's fun and challenging, but it is not easy.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_202.wav|NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_203.wav|Their expressions only reflected those of the audience.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_204.wav|It's up to their parents to choose.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_205.wav|I feel privileged to be here.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_206.wav|If they don't, they might well decide not to play.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_207.wav|She told me to apply for the crest.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_208.wav|Too much has already been said.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_209.wav|John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.|97,,
wav48/p341/p341_210.wav|He explained to his audience.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_211.wav|I think the Government should pay for that.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_212.wav|I asked why he had come.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_213.wav|He was a soldier.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_214.wav|The budget was too low for that.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_215.wav|All inquiries should be made to the police.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_216.wav|It didn't get any better.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_217.wav|I'm a bit annoyed.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_218.wav|He doesn't like the Labour Party.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_219.wav|I am totally devoted to this job.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_220.wav|I just could not cope.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_221.wav|He asked me in a tolerance zone.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_222.wav|It is all one-sided.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_223.wav|I've been thinking about it for a year.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_224.wav|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_225.wav|Here are some possible solutions.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_226.wav|That's the day job.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_227.wav|Glasgow is going to be open for business.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_228.wav|IT was a thoroughly modern affair.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_229.wav|I'm not saying he is finished.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_230.wav|That probably wouldn't happen at Liverpool.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_231.wav|He is well respected by his colleagues.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_232.wav|It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_233.wav|Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_234.wav|I would have dropped out otherwise.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_236.wav|Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_237.wav|Mrs Anderson said this one was different.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_238.wav|We believe we have a strong case.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_239.wav|I lost it at the final whistle.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_240.wav|Bill is a mentor.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_241.wav|They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_242.wav|I think he has undergone a sea change.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_243.wav|One must hope not!|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_244.wav|It was a big day.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_245.wav|What makes a house a home?|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_246.wav|I think however, he was having a fit!|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_247.wav|I live on the streets of Glasgow.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_248.wav|I will not be pressured.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_249.wav|It doesn't make sense.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_250.wav|I'll go back home and see my family.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_251.wav|He admitted the asylum system was not working.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_252.wav|Have we not had the rainy season already?|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_253.wav|I have heard the stories from Scotland.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_254.wav|Sub Not Used, McKay.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_255.wav|Do not listen to them.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_256.wav|Mind you, who wouldn't?|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_257.wav|That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_258.wav|He loves the big occasions.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_259.wav|Our system is archaic.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_260.wav|It was a tactical change.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_261.wav|That's what it's all about, isn't it?|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_262.wav|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_263.wav|This time, there were no such rewards.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_264.wav|He said Mr Holland was a disgrace.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_265.wav|I gave him a way out, and he took it.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_266.wav|Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_267.wav|She became very good at it.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_268.wav|We don't have the credible evidence.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_269.wav|It's one up to the Scots.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_270.wav|I'm just doing artwork.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_271.wav|And we still have to pay his salary.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_272.wav|Also, he was flawed.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_273.wav|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_274.wav|So there's a double whammy.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_275.wav|I didn't have a trio.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_276.wav|Their three other children had died as infants.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_277.wav|That is a mark of what you are.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_278.wav|His wife Margaret was not in court.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_279.wav|Is it the players, or is it the coaches?|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_280.wav|I hope my successor will do the same.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_281.wav|The manager knew me very well.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_282.wav|I have been totally taken aback by this.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_283.wav|Are you in this movie?|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_284.wav|We've got a full house tonight.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_285.wav|If they don't, they won't get what they want.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_286.wav|The fans will support us.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_287.wav|Make sure you see it.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_288.wav|It has, however, been a long time coming.|97,,
wav48/p341/p341_289.wav|We are aware of the two incidents.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_290.wav|We also hope to meet the Ulster Unionists.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_291.wav|It was just one of those things.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_292.wav|The whole team was rubbish.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_293.wav|Now we need to keep our heads up.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_294.wav|You've got it coming Kabul.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_295.wav|They must act now to tighten the rules.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_296.wav|They too refused to come out and talk.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_297.wav|But, mainly, it is up to ourselves.|97,,
wav48/p341/p341_298.wav|It's the curse of our time, irony.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_299.wav|That was enough for the committee.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_300.wav|It's a source of deep concern.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_301.wav|Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_302.wav|But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_303.wav|Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_304.wav|It is a very resilient and deadly bacterium.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_305.wav|However, there are also many areas of agreement.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_306.wav|Last month he made his debut in Japan.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_307.wav|The Dow Jones is way up.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_308.wav|We have to adapt to this level.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_309.wav|They were the better side on the day.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_310.wav|What are you going to do exactly?|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_311.wav|We have lost the round, but not the fight.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_312.wav|There is nothing like a fresh start.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_313.wav|Calderwood would agree with that.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_314.wav|No-one thought about this.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_315.wav|We're all in a state of shock.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_316.wav|I thought he was part of the camera.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_317.wav|You will never forget the clutching horror.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_318.wav|Farmers have been an endangered species.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_319.wav|This is very bad news.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_320.wav|He was released in March this year.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_321.wav|No-one, however, was complacent about the size of the task.|97,,
wav48/p341/p341_322.wav|I stayed away from the defence.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_323.wav|We do need to get the message across.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_324.wav|Instead, she just went away.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_325.wav|That did not go down well.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_326.wav|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_327.wav|It was chaotic and frightening.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_328.wav|It is a question of balance.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_329.wav|Soon the whole country will be level.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_330.wav|And huge, indeed, it is.|97,,
wav48/p341/p341_331.wav|Tax is a matter for national governments.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_332.wav|I'm not interested in coming up with answers.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_333.wav|Lambert will be playing against Belgium.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_334.wav|For his opposite number, this was just triumph.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_335.wav|He said he needed no more evidence.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_336.wav|People might not actually want the job.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_337.wav|It is the logical extension of audio description.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_338.wav|It broke up my marriage.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_339.wav|They told us about it the next day.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_340.wav|Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_341.wav|If there is default.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_342.wav|We are very nearly there.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_343.wav|He also was in debt to drug dealers.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_344.wav|We have to go for it.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_345.wav|I'm surprised that it has taken this approach.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_346.wav|Barry will be able to handle this.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_347.wav|This is entirely appropriate and overdue.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_348.wav|The urgency is real.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_349.wav|I've already got them in.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_350.wav|He takes time out for everyone.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_351.wav|The science is well known, the solution is simple.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_352.wav|They are just bewildered and very concerned.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_353.wav|I can't stop people thinking.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_354.wav|The workers said they were treated like animals.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_355.wav|I have not been so angry for years.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_356.wav|She had every right to read the warrant.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_357.wav|This is normal for him now.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_358.wav|Nothing was going to go right.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_359.wav|There is too much at stake for that.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_360.wav|Nobody ever gets to see them.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_361.wav|That's an old idea.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_362.wav|Scotland is losing business.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_363.wav|The place became a war zone.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_364.wav|What's happening to her?|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_365.wav|It was to get even better for Motherwell.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_366.wav|Both parties can win, and Scotland can win as a result.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_367.wav|The surprise is its product is so poor.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_368.wav|I don't have a new house.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_369.wav|It's always nice to play on Centre Court.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_370.wav|Thus the story will continue to thrive.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_371.wav|You are a liar.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_372.wav|Her advice for Glasgow is just be visionary.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_373.wav|He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_374.wav|See it while you can.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_375.wav|Folk music is in her blood.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_376.wav|And we all understand that.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_377.wav|One policeman was killed.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_378.wav|And it's not funny.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_379.wav|I didn't do too badly myself.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_380.wav|We cannot lose it.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_381.wav|They have learned from that.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_382.wav|We have been working together for some years.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_383.wav|Chris Paterson is a class act.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_384.wav|We only lost the third goal.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_385.wav|And that's the question for the Chamber.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_386.wav|That gave us some confidence.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_387.wav|No-one has yet been charged.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_388.wav|Such people do not exist.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_389.wav|Is this new report the answer?|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_390.wav|Then came the second round.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_391.wav|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_392.wav|There was someone on the floor.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_393.wav|Story time is over - it's a war.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_394.wav|Maybe, who knows?|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_395.wav|However, this idea is never developed.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_396.wav|But it is all by design.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_397.wav|It was a sell-out.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_398.wav|We've still got a say in this.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_399.wav|Things are going very well.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_400.wav|She can't say where she was, what she did.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_401.wav|I'll take what comes along.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_402.wav|Jack McConnell is the obvious choice.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_403.wav|She will just have wanted her baby.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_404.wav|Golf has lost a great character.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_405.wav|You have to have some hope and faith.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_406.wav|They hold on for many years.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_407.wav|However, the report was incorrect.|97,,,
wav48/p341/p341_408.wav|Women reported more depression than men.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_409.wav|He needs to be.|97,,,,
wav48/p341/p341_410.wav|The euro is your money, it is our money.|97,,,
wav48/p343/p343_001.wav|Please call Stella.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|98,,
wav48/p343/p343_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|98,,
wav48/p343/p343_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_019.wav|Since the physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_020.wav|Many contemplated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|98,,
wav48/p343/p343_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|98,,
wav48/p343/p343_025.wav|I've got a long way to go.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_026.wav|I'll go to the races.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_027.wav|We will be back next year.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_028.wav|I was very, very pleased with our display.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_029.wav|It is a crucial award.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_030.wav|People don't feel safe, including me.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_031.wav|Survival is our aim.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_032.wav|But it might have done.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_033.wav|Nor is it likely to do so.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_034.wav|What can you do?|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_035.wav|I read it every year.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_036.wav|I go in for the parts.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_037.wav|It should be the reverse.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_038.wav|We are a team of hard workers.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_039.wav|It is up to Ann.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_040.wav|And you know something?|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_041.wav|We were with him the whole time.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_042.wav|That was the theory, anyway.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_043.wav|We've all been here before.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_044.wav|I had troubles with the producers.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_045.wav|So, it took me back to boarding school.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_046.wav|He died the following year.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_047.wav|That's what we're trying to achieve.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_048.wav|He is trying really hard.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_049.wav|I have no doubt about that.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_050.wav|It is a beautiful country.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_051.wav|I expect a rapid response.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_052.wav|There was still more disquiet in Israel.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_053.wav|This was never a support group.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_054.wav|I must take a seat.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_055.wav|My mother is a widow.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_056.wav|Being a taxi driver right now is horrible.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_057.wav|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_058.wav|The matter will come up again.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_059.wav|I don't believe in gesture politics.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_060.wav|The decision is purely down to the clinic.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_061.wav|He should be a great asset.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_062.wav|But that's another story for another day.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_063.wav|One thing is sure.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_064.wav|He has really done well.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_065.wav|I'm just delighted to take it.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_066.wav|This happened on three days inside a week.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_067.wav|Funding needs to be long term.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_068.wav|It's funny how it comes and goes.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_069.wav|It was just awful.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_070.wav|That is really all.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_071.wav|We played too deeply.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_072.wav|We could have got three medals.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_073.wav|I am ready to go.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_074.wav|We are still suffering from that.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_075.wav|The script was funny.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_076.wav|We are at the crossroads.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_077.wav|I am about protecting the state pension.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_078.wav|They were at school together.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_079.wav|I am looking forward to getting home.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_080.wav|Painful, but only because it's true.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_081.wav|Once they go away they won't come back.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_082.wav|Colonel, About this committee that is coming.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_083.wav|That was the easy election.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_084.wav|I didn't understand it.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_085.wav|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_086.wav|Both sides have been hit by injury.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_087.wav|No one was listening.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_088.wav|I will report in the spring.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_089.wav|We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_090.wav|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.|98,,
wav48/p343/p343_091.wav|It's terrible that this is happening.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_092.wav|He's got the same story.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_093.wav|They were going through the motions, but that's about all.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_094.wav|It is par for the course, of course.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_095.wav|And so it goes on.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_096.wav|The winner will be announced next month.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_097.wav|What was this?|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_098.wav|I am not a fan of books.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_099.wav|It may well have been.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_100.wav|Frankly, the party was not being honest with itself.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_101.wav|We can only go up.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_102.wav|I am not a doctor.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_103.wav|It is all in the mind.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_104.wav|And we have beaten them before.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_105.wav|Many others are subjected to violence by men.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_106.wav|Actually, it turned out to be the concerto.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_107.wav|I am not a paedophile.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_108.wav|I've got to get noticed!|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_109.wav|Not that it was needed.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_110.wav|It's up to them to decide.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_111.wav|But we can't have a casino.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_112.wav|I would love to play in Europe again.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_113.wav|The odds are that it will.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_114.wav|After this, they were always in the driving seat.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_115.wav|I had no intention of misleading anyone.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_116.wav|But let's not get ahead of ourselves.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_117.wav|He also has property interests in the country.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_118.wav|That is the position the MoD has adopted.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_119.wav|The hearing was expected to last six weeks.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_120.wav|I cannot believe this decision.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_121.wav|This decision is destroying my family.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_122.wav|Why is that?|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_123.wav|Well, the big day has arrived.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_124.wav|We reckon we can do very well.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_125.wav|But it's been kept to a minimum.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_126.wav|It has been a great day.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_127.wav|We are not with you.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_128.wav|Then came the crunch.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_129.wav|If so, they were wrong.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_130.wav|It is open season on the Old Firm.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_131.wav|The answer is maybe.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_132.wav|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_133.wav|The referee had a shocking game.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_134.wav|I haven't been able to do it since.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_135.wav|It's about doing things.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_136.wav|For a few years we had good fun.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_137.wav|All the pressure will be on him.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_139.wav|This is the logic of punishment assaults.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_140.wav|That was a good effort.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_141.wav|We are very hopeful he will be cleared.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_142.wav|He must not be removed from office.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_143.wav|He had finally had enough.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_144.wav|But not all were so defiant.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_145.wav|We are not going to get carried away.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_146.wav|I told that to the police.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_147.wav|On the other hand, the poster did not help.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_148.wav|In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_149.wav|But when we do it it is great.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_150.wav|I'm going to win the gold.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_151.wav|He pleaded for caution.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_152.wav|It always had to be about the gym.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_153.wav|Only one got through.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_154.wav|It's like a garage.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_155.wav|They've been wonderful to me.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_157.wav|I can't believe the buzz.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_158.wav|It is a traffic warden.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_159.wav|When it comes down to it, this is a job.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_160.wav|It had been played at festivals.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_161.wav|That never came to court as a charge.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_162.wav|Dancing was her life.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_163.wav|The latter way is my way.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_164.wav|Staff have been informed.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_165.wav|It is one of those things.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_166.wav|His is a success story by any standard.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_167.wav|Are his works inside out?|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_168.wav|He can do no wrong.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_169.wav|On reflection, it was really quite exciting.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_170.wav|Do they have to create seven majors?|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_171.wav|It has been handled entirely properly.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_172.wav|I shall be voting Yes to support him.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_173.wav|Is something which we just don't do.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_174.wav|That began as an accident.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_175.wav|It is, though the law is not clear cut.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_176.wav|He will want to utilise the midfield.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_177.wav|Two others were also seriously injured.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_178.wav|I am looking forward to this film.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_179.wav|This has been very frustrating for him.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_180.wav|The talking cannot go on too long.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_181.wav|I've got a young family.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_182.wav|I hope that that will be forthcoming.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_183.wav|But experience is a wonderful thing.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_184.wav|Footage has been passed on to the police.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_185.wav|Of course, there was still much to be done.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_186.wav|If he does, he has a real chance of gold.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_187.wav|Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_188.wav|It was good today.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_189.wav|She really suffered for her art.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_190.wav|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_191.wav|That tells you something.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_192.wav|It has been a magical moment.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_193.wav|Is that not uncanny?|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_194.wav|Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_195.wav|The hotel was huge.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_196.wav|These days are over.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_197.wav|A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_198.wav|Well, you can have a tree.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_199.wav|Or so it is hoped.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_201.wav|He said to give a local injection.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_202.wav|This is an internal matter.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_203.wav|Entries from the event are still being accepted.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_204.wav|They made such decisions in London.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_205.wav|That has proved to be a lasting lesson.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_206.wav|I was influenced by all of these things.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_207.wav|He is helping police with their inquiries.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_208.wav|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_209.wav|Children also died in Britain.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_210.wav|I did not understand the dynamics of Scotland.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_211.wav|We want to get there.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_213.wav|His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_214.wav|He said he would appeal the sentences.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_215.wav|The hearing was fair.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_216.wav|He has the edge.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_217.wav|This was not a summit about the euro.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_218.wav|If he leaves, the band is finished.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_219.wav|He saw it all as a big game.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_220.wav|I didn't actually work up a speech.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_221.wav|Here we have not had one hour.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_222.wav|That was never their agenda.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_223.wav|But he kept on repeating it.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_224.wav|She is currently in foster care.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_225.wav|That's the only thing that matters.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_226.wav|They were understanding and thoroughly deserved their win.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_227.wav|The service will only survive with change.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_228.wav|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.|98,,
wav48/p343/p343_229.wav|As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_230.wav|You have a very persuasive president.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_231.wav|It's always the same, isn't it?|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_232.wav|She has not returned to work.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_233.wav|We could learn a lot from them.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_234.wav|He is the saviour of South Africa.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_235.wav|The players are obviously keen to do well.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_236.wav|Men should avoid it like the plague.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_237.wav|It's really good fun.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_238.wav|Our positions remains unchanged.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_239.wav|We are expecting a big crowd.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_240.wav|Is a drug dealer?|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_241.wav|We did not complete the process.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_242.wav|Obviously, people are worried in the West Midlands.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_243.wav|Where are you taking her?|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_244.wav|The weather forecast isn't good.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_245.wav|They have not been named.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_246.wav|He died later in hospital.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_247.wav|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_248.wav|He had a great game.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_249.wav|It's still got that at its heart.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_250.wav|Actually, nothing much will change.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_251.wav|We will turn the corner.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_252.wav|Of course, it is a tough assignment.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_253.wav|There were too many mistakes.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_254.wav|He says it often enough.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_255.wav|However, my position remains the same.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_256.wav|It was totally out of the blue.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_257.wav|Horses are not affected.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_258.wav|It went on forever.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_259.wav|I'm not going to change from it.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_260.wav|And they are different.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_261.wav|It would have been very easily done.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_262.wav|He knows the course.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_263.wav|That idea is rubbish.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_264.wav|There is no room for error.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_265.wav|Worry can have that effect on some citizens.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_266.wav|As, indeed, they would be.|98,,
wav48/p343/p343_267.wav|If he could have prevented it happening, he would have.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_268.wav|We are all suffering.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_269.wav|People should make their own decisions.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_270.wav|That is a question for the next manager.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_271.wav|I knew people on that committee.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_273.wav|Again, we were lucky.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_274.wav|There was no argument.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_275.wav|He certainly didn't say he was a journalist.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_276.wav|She is a valuable member of Government.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_277.wav|I just need a bit of luck.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_278.wav|But it's not the end of Scottish football.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_279.wav|We are talking about one family.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_280.wav|He is not a pathetic figure.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_281.wav|The error appeared in a warrant.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_282.wav|Everything is so new.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_283.wav|It may take time to get it back.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_284.wav|Would they work together again?|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_285.wav|I can feel the sound inside.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_286.wav|The answer is yes.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_287.wav|I believe in debate and dialogue.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_288.wav|The second aspect was the fear of failure.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_289.wav|That is a personal matter.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_290.wav|The princess has had other health problems.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_291.wav|I would rather say nothing at the moment.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_292.wav|The clarity is vital.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_293.wav|I could not sit in the stands.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_294.wav|He had a decision to make.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_295.wav|Strikers like to go to the ground.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_296.wav|It makes no influence on the public.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_297.wav|It's ahead of Labour.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_298.wav|It's the whole package.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_299.wav|I was totally wrong.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_300.wav|This has got to stop.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_301.wav|It was a matter of chance.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_302.wav|There is no point of looking any further.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_303.wav|It is a real concern.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_304.wav|Is it the flight?|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_306.wav|Strictly speaking, it shouldn't be like this.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_307.wav|Scotland doesn't even have a target.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_308.wav|They really shouldn't have put it out.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_309.wav|A compromise is essential.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_310.wav|Last night, the company could not be contacted.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_311.wav|They need to be involved.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_312.wav|It was not a cover-up.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_313.wav|The children continue to talk to us.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_314.wav|You know the sort of thing.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_315.wav|I cannot say too much about them.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_316.wav|She went home from school and never returned.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_317.wav|I will work on her.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_318.wav|We told them in August.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_319.wav|It is not easy to live in Russia.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_320.wav|Green is desperate to play on The Open.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_321.wav|What on earth is happening to rugby?|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_322.wav|It is now being examined.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_323.wav|It is so out of character.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_324.wav|Otherwise we would all pay the price.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_325.wav|Our thoughts are with her.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_326.wav|It is time, he said.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_327.wav|Everyone believes in it.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_328.wav|We must learn to finish.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_331.wav|He was a one off.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_332.wav|That should give me a chance.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_333.wav|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_334.wav|It is my last chance.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_335.wav|We played them off the pitch.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_336.wav|The service from the other players was super.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_337.wav|That fight begins today for the freedom and liberty.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_338.wav|He didn't let me down.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_339.wav|You have been warned.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_340.wav|We're not comparing like with like.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_341.wav|I started on fire a couple of times.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_342.wav|The Shadow Chancellor is always on holiday.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_343.wav|It wasn't good, but we'll get better.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_344.wav|They will be up for it for sure.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_345.wav|So you let me know.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_346.wav|He, too, was unlucky not to get a goal.|98,,
wav48/p343/p343_347.wav|That will just be the beginning.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_348.wav|No one can say that about me.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_349.wav|That had not happened on this occasion.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_350.wav|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_351.wav|As a nation, we must become more active.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_352.wav|At the moment, Michael is in a class of his own.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_353.wav|It is safe in our hands.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_354.wav|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_355.wav|We will need to look at that.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_356.wav|It comes down to the police in England.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_357.wav|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_358.wav|It is a gamble.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_359.wav|I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_360.wav|The tribunal continues today.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_361.wav|These things have not happened by accident.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_362.wav|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_363.wav|Sure, that already happens in New Zealand.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_364.wav|There's a hint of classical.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_365.wav|We had to take action to protect them.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_366.wav|Surely they were on a hiding to nothing.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_367.wav|In the end, however, it all came together.|98,,
wav48/p343/p343_368.wav|He is a visionary.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_369.wav|The warning was lifted late last night.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_370.wav|There is always the smell.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_371.wav|I have to take some of the blame.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_372.wav|And if he hasn't become a musician?|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_374.wav|He is lying to save his skin.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_375.wav|You have to do your research.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_376.wav|He really has everything, including a beautiful swing.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_377.wav|He took away my childhood.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_378.wav|I have spoken to the skipper.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_379.wav|The call was ignored.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_381.wav|It has happened, and that is the end of the story.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_382.wav|We don't do this for everyone, of course.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_383.wav|And there is another problem.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_384.wav|That is the theory.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_385.wav|It almost certainly is.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_386.wav|They will have five minutes to decide.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_387.wav|Because it's a secret.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_388.wav|My wife and family are the support system.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_389.wav|The body follows the mind.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_390.wav|I've done nothing wrong, and that's the truth.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_391.wav|They are there to help us.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_392.wav|It just isn't a defining issue for them.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_393.wav|You take a risk.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_394.wav|Which he is, too.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_395.wav|Each one is as good as the other.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_396.wav|Sub Not Used, McArthur.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_397.wav|I have hardly any commitments.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_398.wav|There is no formula.|98,,,,
wav48/p343/p343_399.wav|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.|98,,,
wav48/p343/p343_400.wav|I love the feel of the place.|98,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_001.wav|Please call Stella.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|99,,
wav48/p345/p345_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|99,,
wav48/p345/p345_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|99,,
wav48/p345/p345_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|99,,
wav48/p345/p345_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|99,,
wav48/p345/p345_025.wav|This is a new era.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_026.wav|I want to go home.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_027.wav|All the people here are local.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_028.wav|The racist abuse was terrible.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_029.wav|What is the new religion?|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_030.wav|The Farmer is called an idiot.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_031.wav|It's an amazing landscape!|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_032.wav|I am prepared to step down.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_033.wav|It's a lot of pressure on me.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_034.wav|We had to laugh.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_035.wav|It is too pretty, it is too small.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_036.wav|We're in a state of shock and disbelief.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_037.wav|I was completely knackered.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_038.wav|I'd rather be singing Verdi.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_039.wav|A killer is also on the loose.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_040.wav|Rangers are struggling and their team have injuries.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_041.wav|You've got to be vigilant.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_042.wav|You can see how he made his money.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_043.wav|However, there were some alarming findings.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_044.wav|Who wants to be a Millionaire?|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_045.wav|We would certainly consider the proposals.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_046.wav|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_047.wav|His record with England was not good.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_048.wav|The opposite is the case.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_049.wav|Who would be a referee?|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_050.wav|Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.|99,,
wav48/p345/p345_051.wav|It was time to act.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_052.wav|It's a question of fashion.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_053.wav|I could never be cool.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_054.wav|We will be paying agency rates.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_055.wav|Others said he had gone too far.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_056.wav|We expect them to deliver for us.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_057.wav|He was between people and God.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_058.wav|I've never seen anything like it.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_059.wav|They were willing us to get a second.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_060.wav|No casualties were reported.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_061.wav|The classes are taking place.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_062.wav|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_063.wav|The sleeper was six hours late.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_064.wav|There will be no threat to the game.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_065.wav|It would be a last resort.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_066.wav|That is part of athletics.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_067.wav|Who would have known.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_068.wav|We were caught out.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_069.wav|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_070.wav|I haven't made any definite decisions.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_071.wav|I had to lie.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_072.wav|Among them is his beloved teacher.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_073.wav|Everyone was writing me off.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_074.wav|How do we get more people in?|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_075.wav|The defender made an impressive debut.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_076.wav|But her parents will never see her again.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_077.wav|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_078.wav|I have nothing to lose.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_079.wav|He would have loved it.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_080.wav|We should be capable of managing it, though.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_081.wav|It was that kind of afternoon.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_082.wav|It is a freedom.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_083.wav|What happens next?|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_084.wav|All our futures will already have been decided.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_085.wav|I would have been shot dead in bed.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_086.wav|He insisted that his staff were too.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_087.wav|They should come clean.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_088.wav|He was pronounced dead in hospital.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_089.wav|I believe that so strongly.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_090.wav|That, though, is an old story.|99,,
wav48/p345/p345_091.wav|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_092.wav|They don't work anymore anyway.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_093.wav|It's about time something was done about equipment.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_094.wav|It was a funny feeling.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_095.wav|He was at it again yesterday.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_096.wav|You can't go on forever.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_097.wav|So far this season this approach is working.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_098.wav|However, his involvement was instant.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_099.wav|It has to work.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_100.wav|It was, for me, like a week in heaven.|99,,
wav48/p345/p345_101.wav|Certainly, there is much on the agenda.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_102.wav|There's something about being cut off.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_103.wav|This is his personal life.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_104.wav|I asked for a picture and she said, No problem.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_105.wav|If not, a deal could take many months.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_106.wav|It's as eventful as it is momentous.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_107.wav|I was going to help with the dinner.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_108.wav|Would you pay to come and see it?|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_109.wav|What are they like?|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_110.wav|I would probably have to agree with him.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_111.wav|They were back in favour with the SAC.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_112.wav|He had a moustache.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_113.wav|I have been thinking about that this week.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_114.wav|Let's get it on.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_115.wav|Together they will attempt to express the whole.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_116.wav|Everyone is deeply shocked by this appaling accident.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_117.wav|It is really good news.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_118.wav|We just want a fair deal.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_119.wav|I'll just have to live with that.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_120.wav|Neither of them was badly hurt.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_121.wav|He is the Acting and Deputy First Minister.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_122.wav|We wanted it left for a wee while.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_123.wav|At the moment, the success in Germany is good.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_124.wav|It is sad and frustrating.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_125.wav|Our intentions are real.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_126.wav|The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_127.wav|Finding the answer is a hugely enjoyable experience.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_128.wav|She has left the island.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_129.wav|That will be the case on Tuesday.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_130.wav|As to rugby, well, no-one knows.|99,,
wav48/p345/p345_131.wav|It certainly should not be used too often.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_132.wav|The whole matter is done and dusted.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_133.wav|I don't know where that one came from.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_134.wav|The shooting created panic in the street.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_135.wav|He would just say it was terrible.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_136.wav|Our destiny is in our own hands.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_137.wav|That's not fair to the supporters.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_138.wav|I was on my own.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_139.wav|They were part of our own family.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_140.wav|It doesn't exactly have the same appeal.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_141.wav|I don't have any perspective on it.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_142.wav|Scotland has lost a great man.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_143.wav|Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_144.wav|In fact, they will not be disciplined.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_145.wav|His name has not been released.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_146.wav|For some, it was more painful than others.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_147.wav|It plainly does not work.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_148.wav|His words were not audible.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_149.wav|That's a huge amount.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_150.wav|See the amazing arrogance of this, they say.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_151.wav|It was even worse than at home.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_152.wav|I still think he will win.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_153.wav|But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_154.wav|Normally it would be four minutes.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_155.wav|It may have been a cry for help.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_156.wav|But the damage had been done.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_157.wav|No, you couldn't make it up.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_158.wav|We are trying to clarify the issues.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_159.wav|However, he did not stay there very long.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_160.wav|And so they have.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_161.wav|I have a great respect for her.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_162.wav|I suggest a new plan.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_163.wav|IT takes the biscuit.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_164.wav|But perhaps we shouldn't worry too much.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_165.wav|We don't have a solution to the problem.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_166.wav|Miller was every bit as happy.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_167.wav|The result is utterly compelling.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_168.wav|But it won't be the same.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_169.wav|Other forces were, however, at work.|99,,
wav48/p345/p345_170.wav|Inspiring public confidence is crucial.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_171.wav|It is a hobby for me.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_172.wav|If only the acting profession was that simple.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_173.wav|It was like a kick in the belly.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_174.wav|Bombing is the easy option.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_175.wav|We should have gone solo.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_176.wav|Directing, if you like.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_177.wav|That will be the case.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_178.wav|Now, it's all right.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_179.wav|All will be revealed in due course.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_180.wav|They have known the hard times.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_181.wav|We don't know what happened.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_182.wav|You cannot enter the clubhouse.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_183.wav|They had seven children.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_184.wav|That in itself is an erotic experience.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_185.wav|Death is outside the language.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_186.wav|You have a plan?|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_187.wav|It's all too early.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_188.wav|Everything in the world was focused on London.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_189.wav|We've seen that time and time again.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_190.wav|I was never alone with her, right?|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_191.wav|It's not only my respect for them.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_192.wav|Tonight's matches European Championship.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_193.wav|This is a very high price.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_194.wav|That's when you hope to take advantage.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_195.wav|I never want to have any children.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_196.wav|Business has never been so bad.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_197.wav|There is no way to do this.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_198.wav|Edinburgh was not included in the survey.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_199.wav|I know my sons.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_200.wav|Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_201.wav|It was too close to call.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_202.wav|But who is the killer?|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_203.wav|No, it's never been mentioned.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_204.wav|Things were so intense in the studio.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_205.wav|The devil, of course, will be in the detail.|99,,
wav48/p345/p345_206.wav|Then another one came.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_207.wav|Progress is being made but it is slow.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_208.wav|Everything has been destroyed.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_209.wav|The Lobby is not failing.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_210.wav|But it is looking very positive.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_211.wav|Drugs are getting through.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_212.wav|He would have come into the house.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_213.wav|I want to put myself on discussion also.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_214.wav|It happens in real life.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_215.wav|At the time, he was a living legend.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_216.wav|And we will do it.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_217.wav|It's a human tragedy.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_218.wav|But we are losing that connection.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_219.wav|I am going to fight to the end.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_220.wav|Either group is living in fantasy land.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_221.wav|It's the right thing.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_222.wav|That was a disgraceful performance.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_223.wav|Must have been at the bar.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_224.wav|But this is just the start.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_225.wav|I can't get away from it.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_226.wav|I believe in the Union.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_227.wav|SCOTLAND has shown the way.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_228.wav|But he is not hopeful.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_229.wav|It will be all about the Olympics.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_230.wav|They are very frightened.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_231.wav|We have all been there at some point.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_232.wav|This is my homeland.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_233.wav|The game was up.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_234.wav|That is not an easy thing.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_235.wav|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_236.wav|I didn't know where they were.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_237.wav|Rangers are my life.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_238.wav|Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_239.wav|Three weeks later, he resigned.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_240.wav|There are two options.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_241.wav|I can't describe it.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_242.wav|Surely it should be the other way round.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_243.wav|There is a handful of rewarding paintings.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_244.wav|I get on him, he gets on me.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_245.wav|This is wonderful news.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_246.wav|I am appalled by this news.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_247.wav|No injuries were reported.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_248.wav|It is not surprising, but it is appaling.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_249.wav|It is understood he had been stabbed.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_250.wav|It's too much work.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_251.wav|We were extremely arrogant.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_252.wav|Actually, it's an amazing orchestra.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_253.wav|THE waiting game continues.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_254.wav|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_255.wav|I don't think he was being very fair.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_256.wav|You've got to fight to stay up.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_257.wav|But the foundations have been laid.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_258.wav|We're looking for unity in the council.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_259.wav|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_260.wav|What is so unusual about this case?|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_261.wav|Fatherhood is important to Tony Blair.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_262.wav|But this is different.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_263.wav|I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_264.wav|It doesn't look good.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_265.wav|That will not change.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_267.wav|Her presence was almost everywhere.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_268.wav|Asylum seekers are still being attacked and abused.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_269.wav|It doesn't make a whole lot of difference.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_270.wav|There is enormous interest in Scotland the Brand.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_271.wav|They've been at it for five hours.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_272.wav|This action could have been avoided.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_273.wav|The distinction is also supported by doctors.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_274.wav|And they still have the final to come.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_275.wav|Anyone else can apply.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_276.wav|He looked like a schoolboy.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_277.wav|It was like the old days.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_278.wav|But that is about to change.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_279.wav|The whole thing has been a fantastic experience.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_280.wav|We can build on that.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_281.wav|It could be a danger.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_282.wav|We are not going to be complacent.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_283.wav|The only problem was, they were on himself.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_284.wav|His body was found in May.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_285.wav|He's a joy to follow.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_286.wav|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_287.wav|I'm sure you all can relate to that.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_288.wav|My wife is coming over at the weekend.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_289.wav|Sure, he is the best player in the world.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_290.wav|It starts to get you down.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_291.wav|I don't think we could have expected better.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_292.wav|My life has been turned upside down.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_293.wav|Somebody has to speak up for common sense.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_294.wav|But they miss the whole point.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_295.wav|You have to count on other people.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_296.wav|I said, What was that about?|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_297.wav|Immediate action must be taken.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_298.wav|This could prove a problem.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_299.wav|I was a local hero.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_300.wav|He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_301.wav|It will be extremely difficult for him.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_302.wav|It's a gigantic con.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_303.wav|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_304.wav|This club have been fair to me.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_305.wav|I didn't know she could do that.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_306.wav|What does she consider her greatest achievement?|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_307.wav|This is too much like Scotland.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_308.wav|I can't say anything about any figure.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_309.wav|A counter reaction was.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_310.wav|That goes back a long way.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_311.wav|I wouldn't have had the abandon.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_312.wav|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_313.wav|They were not missing much.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_314.wav|It should not make the same mistake again.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_315.wav|Holiday was certainly no stranger to bigotry.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_316.wav|The record companies have gone through the floor.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_317.wav|It's always a dilemma.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_318.wav|As far as Scotland is concerned, he should relax.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_319.wav|Is she in trouble?|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_320.wav|It is a symbolic concert.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_321.wav|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_322.wav|It is a very beautiful city.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_323.wav|She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_324.wav|But could it afford to run it?|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_325.wav|I am very happy with him.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_326.wav|I was waiting for that question.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_327.wav|Her body was found on Monday morning.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_328.wav|I am not against a further inquiry.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_329.wav|His father said, My son was lucky.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_330.wav|WHO would have thought it?|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_331.wav|We will win the argument.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_332.wav|Five years later, the deception continued.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_333.wav|I might get an injury very easily.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_334.wav|I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_335.wav|Stock markets will be watching closely.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_336.wav|I just want to do the good work.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_337.wav|I'm very happy tonight.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_338.wav|He was overwhelmed by the response.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_339.wav|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_340.wav|Now it was serious.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_341.wav|This is his first movie.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_342.wav|He is already in place.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_343.wav|No one would believe him.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_344.wav|We live in shorthand.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_345.wav|But something has been lost in the translation.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_346.wav|Spent three months alone at sea.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_347.wav|I made a big mistake.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_348.wav|I just know it's a lot.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_349.wav|I saw one body.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_350.wav|I am very happy.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_351.wav|There was no discussion about it.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_352.wav|Three hours later, the man was free.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_353.wav|It was a very big win for us.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_354.wav|I've never felt affection for Emu.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_355.wav|Everything is up for grabs.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_356.wav|We had a good time.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_357.wav|I was utterly hopeless at it, it must be said.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_358.wav|This was a good performance.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_359.wav|However, the snow was welcomed by some.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_360.wav|It is not simple.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_361.wav|We also enjoyed a lot of support.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_362.wav|Our task is to complete the picture.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_363.wav|It is a road of death.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_364.wav|The Government would be ready, they said.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_365.wav|Her life is now back on track.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_366.wav|I said at the time it was wrong.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_367.wav|By now he was very ill with cancer.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_368.wav|Anything that was going, really.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_369.wav|He will take it in his stride.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_370.wav|I don't believe a word of it.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_371.wav|I couldn't put my finger on it.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_372.wav|People can really get themselves in a mess.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_373.wav|The winner will be announced in December.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_374.wav|This is bound to happen.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_375.wav|Suddenly, there was an audience.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_376.wav|It has not yet opened to pupils.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_377.wav|The letters are going out today.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_378.wav|I did not name it.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_379.wav|And therein lies the problem.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_380.wav|I also thought, This is a feature film.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_381.wav|McMaster had already seen the first part.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_382.wav|Or is it?|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_383.wav|Is he going to look after them?|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_384.wav|They are appealing for witnesses.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_385.wav|This is the last chance, and everyone knows it.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_386.wav|It is quite simple.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_389.wav|It does affect the staff and the prisoners.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_390.wav|His instructions were clear.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_391.wav|There is ample evidence.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_392.wav|It was a game we had to win.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_393.wav|I've never had problems with any football managers.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_394.wav|To begin with it looks good.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_395.wav|I won't go back to Holland.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_396.wav|There is still a long way to go.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_397.wav|Almost overnight, he found his voice.|99,,,
wav48/p345/p345_398.wav|This was a unique election.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_399.wav|It was still there last night.|99,,,,
wav48/p345/p345_400.wav|In his absence, the council adopted the change.|99,,,
wav48/p347/p347_001.wav|Please call Stella.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|100,,
wav48/p347/p347_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|100,,
wav48/p347/p347_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|100,,
wav48/p347/p347_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|100,,
wav48/p347/p347_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|100,,
wav48/p347/p347_025.wav|A crucial moment has arrived.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_026.wav|We still have a long, long way to go.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_027.wav|Some will be deployed on submarines.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_028.wav|There are moments of silence.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_029.wav|So now this series has had its day.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_030.wav|Gaelic provision continued to be good.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_031.wav|Bobby Robson called him a genius.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_032.wav|It's a policy which has worked for us.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_033.wav|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.|100,,
wav48/p347/p347_034.wav|That didn't happen for two reasons.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_035.wav|His views are hardly surprising.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_036.wav|It is time for a new approach.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_037.wav|And look at the leading conductors, he says.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_038.wav|We have nothing to say about that.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_039.wav|We've tried every other way.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_040.wav|I'll have to go out and impress.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_041.wav|Slowly, however, a picture is emerging in Scotland.|100,,
wav48/p347/p347_043.wav|He had a really frustrating time last year.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_044.wav|It does make a big difference.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_045.wav|How many cases have there been?|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_046.wav|Peter, of course, refuses to conform.|100,,
wav48/p347/p347_047.wav|You can't give in to the vandals.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_048.wav|The Old Firm are going nowhere.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_049.wav|Everything was an effort.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_050.wav|And does it even matter?|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_051.wav|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_052.wav|My parents are exhausted.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_053.wav|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.|100,,
wav48/p347/p347_054.wav|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.|100,,
wav48/p347/p347_055.wav|If he does not leave, he will be shot.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_056.wav|My thoughts are with their families.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_057.wav|It will come up here.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_058.wav|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_059.wav|Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_060.wav|It is a very special city.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_061.wav|This is only the start of my season.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_062.wav|The message is just not getting through.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_063.wav|It sounded awfully like panic.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_064.wav|I've taken to the hills.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_065.wav|This is a big, big win.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_066.wav|The crowd was awesome.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_067.wav|My game is in pretty good shape.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_068.wav|We were given a break.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_069.wav|He already had had complaints.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_070.wav|How come it is so often unnoticed?|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_071.wav|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_072.wav|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_073.wav|They had not been handcuffed.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_074.wav|I think we will join the single currency.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_075.wav|Then it was the turn of the carnival.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_076.wav|You have to rely on each other.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_077.wav|One thing is certain.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_078.wav|We cannot ask for them back.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_079.wav|It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_080.wav|No-one said anything to me.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_081.wav|All of us do.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_082.wav|That is in the public domain.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_083.wav|The Hague is too good for him.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_084.wav|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_085.wav|In just a fortnight, however, everything has changed.|100,,
wav48/p347/p347_086.wav|It's a true story.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_087.wav|This is a club on the rise.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_088.wav|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_089.wav|Theatre is not a museum.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_090.wav|It is a hangover effect.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_091.wav|This is my life.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_092.wav|Subs not used, McCulloch.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_093.wav|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_094.wav|The thing is to recognise that chance.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_095.wav|We gave them the goal.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_096.wav|They don't take you to mass graves.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_097.wav|There was no option.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_098.wav|What's it got to do with art?|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_099.wav|Could they perhaps be related?|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_100.wav|But who shot the president?|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_101.wav|We do not get that impression now.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_102.wav|I'm looking forward to that.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_103.wav|It was not a beautiful game, was it?|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_104.wav|Safety was also an issue.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_105.wav|That's why he visited.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_106.wav|I know a lot of people who don't.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_107.wav|There was nobody on the roof.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_108.wav|Clark is back on top form.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_109.wav|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.|100,,
wav48/p347/p347_110.wav|It needs somebody to give way.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_111.wav|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_112.wav|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_113.wav|They are all Arabs.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_114.wav|The days of empty promises are over.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_115.wav|Henry was strong and talented.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_116.wav|That is our unfinished business.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_117.wav|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_118.wav|Faces from the Eighties.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_119.wav|Why did it take a concerted campaign?|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_120.wav|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.|100,
wav48/p347/p347_121.wav|Whatever he does, however, it will be decisive.|100,,
wav48/p347/p347_122.wav|You can cope with it.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_123.wav|It is an interesting title, Believing in Britain.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_124.wav|They will do their own thing.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_125.wav|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_126.wav|We are in the business of selling tickets.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_127.wav|It is just part of modern day life.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_128.wav|A young Briton had a lucky escape.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_129.wav|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_130.wav|Treatment is not an issue with these people.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_131.wav|YOU thought it was a headache.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_132.wav|All the people thought that we would die.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_133.wav|It is never an easy game.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_134.wav|This year it will be Billy Crystal.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_135.wav|No-one else is like Michael Jackson.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_136.wav|I don't want to come down.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_137.wav|However, it's good to turn the page.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_138.wav|I thought it was quite good.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_139.wav|He had reason to be pleased.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_140.wav|It was important to win the singles.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_141.wav|That is impressive by any standards.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_142.wav|I felt we needed to bring that in.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_143.wav|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_144.wav|I'm thinking, what would be easier?|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_145.wav|That alibi is now gone.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_146.wav|But the cost to his health was enormous.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_147.wav|Too many factors are now working against him.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_148.wav|Is the war over?|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_149.wav|You do have a way out.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_150.wav|It is simple, really.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_151.wav|I just wasn't very good.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_152.wav|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_153.wav|But he is not using them.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_154.wav|Christians in Pakistan are terrified.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_155.wav|I certainly believe we can do it.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_156.wav|They've got a sort of unwritten contract.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_157.wav|It was a breathtaking moment.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_158.wav|That's been our position all along.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_159.wav|I was in jail for five years.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_160.wav|We have not had a formal request.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_161.wav|I never had a childhood.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_162.wav|Its effect on humans is not yet known.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_163.wav|We offered something different.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_164.wav|We were very much a happy family.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_165.wav|They won the trophy in the Hoops.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_166.wav|It is true, but it is only part of the issue.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_167.wav|It's going to be epic.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_168.wav|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.|100,,
wav48/p347/p347_169.wav|It was large enough to fit the wall.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_170.wav|She could easily have been killed.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_171.wav|British officials said they could not say.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_172.wav|Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.|100,
wav48/p347/p347_173.wav|I never found my rhythm.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_174.wav|I didn't mean to kill her.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_175.wav|It is a job creation scheme.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_176.wav|In less than two months, the women have achieved a lot.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_177.wav|We might be back next year.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_178.wav|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_179.wav|The same goes for personnel.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_180.wav|Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_181.wav|In fact, they should have scored three times.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_182.wav|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_183.wav|This area is perfect for children.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_184.wav|The firm was down and almost out.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_185.wav|I was chosen to do this.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_186.wav|I learned a lot from that.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_187.wav|I think we're very different.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_188.wav|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_189.wav|There was an element of jealousy.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_190.wav|Glasgow then took control.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_191.wav|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.|100,,
wav48/p347/p347_192.wav|My ambitions are still with football.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_193.wav|That certainly brought me back down to earth.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_194.wav|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_195.wav|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_196.wav|We have no idea what caused the derailment.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_197.wav|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_198.wav|Our approach will be different.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_199.wav|It's not right of Labour.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_200.wav|It is legally binding.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_201.wav|We went straight into the bedroom.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_202.wav|Before the games it was pretty open.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_203.wav|But you can go beyond that condition.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_204.wav|He is only now regaining his confidence.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_205.wav|Singing has gone out of fashion.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_206.wav|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_207.wav|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_208.wav|Who can tell?|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_209.wav|However, the great thing is that it doesn't matter.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_210.wav|They might also be reviewed by their colleagues.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_211.wav|My attitude is exactly the same as before.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_212.wav|I've invented a village in East Lothian.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_213.wav|Or some thought that they have.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_214.wav|He has lost confidence and weight.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_215.wav|That was moving the goalposts.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_216.wav|This process of attrition is expected to continue.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_217.wav|A Treasury spokesman derided the Tory charge.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_218.wav|You'll get on like a house on fire.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_219.wav|Two and a half million people have died.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_220.wav|It could not be too high.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_221.wav|Or so it would appear.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_222.wav|Do not forget about Monaco.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_223.wav|I hope they understand that.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_224.wav|You can never tell.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_225.wav|But Annika is just amazing.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_226.wav|Our job is to change that.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_227.wav|She will also get a pay rise.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_228.wav|The damage has been done.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_229.wav|It is time for a more honest approach.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_230.wav|That's the National Grid.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_231.wav|That is very, very bad news for our nation.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_232.wav|Nobody can change it overnight, but you can make a start.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_233.wav|It is a big time for me.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_234.wav|There were two things going on at once.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_235.wav|He wouldn't allow that to happen.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_236.wav|It is a cause for concern.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_237.wav|Stalkers are capable of killing.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_238.wav|That is the key message.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_239.wav|It ignores the future.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_240.wav|This is the subway.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_241.wav|Altman has every right to be bitter.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_242.wav|What's the rush?|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_243.wav|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_244.wav|He's in with the furniture.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_245.wav|Do not go into government buildings.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_246.wav|There is only one caveat.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_247.wav|We are still getting signals.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_248.wav|What's it got to do with them, anyway?|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_249.wav|I am happy to play for Aberdeen.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_250.wav|Nothing is being offered in exchange.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_251.wav|Everyone can be bought.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_252.wav|There are a few changes.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_253.wav|You're not going to get hurt.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_254.wav|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_255.wav|The New Deal will constantly be improved.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_256.wav|THE headless man has finally developed a face.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_257.wav|I heard some of his remarks.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_258.wav|I am a little bit tired.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_259.wav|Staff should be paid for what they produce.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_260.wav|I was just overwhelmed.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_261.wav|It had been in place since last July.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_262.wav|I have just got to get back.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_263.wav|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_264.wav|Players want to know what is on offer.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_265.wav|Well, when did he ever refuse?|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_266.wav|We will have to see, but it makes you think.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_267.wav|I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_268.wav|The singer's condition was not specified.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_269.wav|How much of a cop out is that?|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_270.wav|The whole region is in shock.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_271.wav|It was a journey into a new life.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_272.wav|It will be the final push.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_273.wav|Life, as many people know it, in other words.|100,,
wav48/p347/p347_274.wav|You were the kidnappers.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_275.wav|It is a very interesting subject.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_276.wav|Arguably, they have already done it.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_277.wav|She had been in Germany for medical treatment.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_278.wav|Raymond was always on the outside.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_279.wav|The women were on their way home yesterday.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_280.wav|I could feel the blood on my face.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_281.wav|I am a committed European.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_282.wav|There are no plans to change this.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_283.wav|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_284.wav|It's in the eyes.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_285.wav|Working with him is like working with myself.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_286.wav|It is just too long since the war.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_287.wav|She didn't tell us anything new.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_288.wav|I mean it happens.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_289.wav|My wife is totally behind me on this.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_290.wav|Debbie Harry was cool.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_291.wav|Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_292.wav|Receiving this medal is an honour.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_293.wav|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_294.wav|Six months later, they returned to Scotland.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_295.wav|It is typical of me.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_296.wav|Raised the way you want it.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_297.wav|However, consumers may take a different view.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_298.wav|I know you went back this morning.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_299.wav|They played it like a cup final.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_300.wav|This has a number of benefits.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_301.wav|I will carry on.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_302.wav|I think it is a great shame.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_303.wav|A review of the decision is being sought.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_304.wav|It will be about commitment, not compliance.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_305.wav|The chief constable is right.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_306.wav|And we were right.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_307.wav|That is where the club has gone wrong.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_308.wav|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_309.wav|Surely it can do better than that?|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_310.wav|It's my favourite place to hang out.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_311.wav|I think that could work to our advantage.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_312.wav|I, like an idiot, agreed.|100,,
wav48/p347/p347_313.wav|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_314.wav|He will make an excellent chief inspector.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_315.wav|We hope this scheme will change that.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_316.wav|I cannot confirm the name of any driver.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_317.wav|The red card was okay.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_318.wav|The Government has to grasp the nettle.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_319.wav|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.|100,,
wav48/p347/p347_320.wav|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_321.wav|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_322.wav|I was doing well at the hustings.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_323.wav|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_324.wav|This is my music.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_325.wav|I haven't won the world title.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_326.wav|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_327.wav|It's fantastic to have finally won.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_328.wav|But she's also beautiful behind the face.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_329.wav|There is no date on this document.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_330.wav|And now he tells us.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_331.wav|I am not changing my event.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_332.wav|I know nothing about that.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_333.wav|Ferguson did not hesitate.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_334.wav|That is as it may be.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_335.wav|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.|100,,
wav48/p347/p347_336.wav|This is the start of a new campaign.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_337.wav|Eleven events are required.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_338.wav|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_339.wav|You encourage them - you can do it.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_340.wav|The winner will be announced by early summer.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_341.wav|I always said No.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_342.wav|Britain is a peaceful nation.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_343.wav|Government must recognise the problems of Aberdeen.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_344.wav|It is very much a matter for them.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_345.wav|Our future was his future.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_346.wav|His name is Michael Owen.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_347.wav|It has made a difference.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_348.wav|He's got a great chance of making it.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_349.wav|Tartan Day is not a Scottish event.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_350.wav|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.|100,,
wav48/p347/p347_351.wav|So now you know.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_352.wav|But, at the same time, they made you think about life.|100,,
wav48/p347/p347_353.wav|It's a very special unit.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_354.wav|We will learn lessons from what has happened.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_355.wav|I foolishly had done nothing about it.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_356.wav|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_357.wav|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_358.wav|Smith has not let him down.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_359.wav|Which he can do.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_360.wav|No, it's actually in a block of flats.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_361.wav|They were that poor.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_362.wav|And we're talking Big Money.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_363.wav|His silence on the issue is interesting.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_364.wav|I was a little surprised.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_365.wav|It was a bit like having children.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_366.wav|With Pierre, you can never be sure.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_367.wav|They believed it worked.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_368.wav|I'm really proud of my young players.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_369.wav|As it happened, it was much more than that.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_370.wav|It's an internal matter.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_371.wav|They should feel ashamed.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_372.wav|You realise what this means?|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_373.wav|We're delighted about the vote.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_374.wav|They were only there for three weeks.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_375.wav|I'm just looking to take my chances.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_376.wav|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_377.wav|It is just completely erased.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_378.wav|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_379.wav|It's been like that for ages, according to the guys.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_380.wav|It's not just for classical music.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_381.wav|This must be kept in total perspective.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_382.wav|Election results are expected soon.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_383.wav|All of the names are familiar to me.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_384.wav|There are moments of honesty, too.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_385.wav|They didn't find anything.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_386.wav|Is that where we are?|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_387.wav|We used to keep our business rates.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_388.wav|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_389.wav|I suspect that it will.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_390.wav|But there's no eye contact.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_391.wav|There was no energy behind it.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_392.wav|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_393.wav|Even for a British Open, this is different.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_394.wav|I took a minibus into town.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_395.wav|They have not allowed them to defend themselves.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_396.wav|Completion is expected by October the following year.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_397.wav|It is not a wish list.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_398.wav|Some of the players have not progressed.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_399.wav|They were both very brave.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_400.wav|There is no margin for error.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_401.wav|Why should we even be asked to share?|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_402.wav|It was not a foul.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_403.wav|I get very excited by that.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_404.wav|The members have clearly spoken.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_405.wav|In the end, it will mean an awful lot.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_406.wav|I believe in God.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_407.wav|Which means it matters.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_408.wav|There is great potential on this river.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_409.wav|We can't win a big game.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_410.wav|It was a stunning strike.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_411.wav|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_412.wav|She said he showed no remorse.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_413.wav|We are going through difficult times.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_414.wav|There can be no compromise on that demand.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_415.wav|What exactly is your job?|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_416.wav|However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_417.wav|There's nothing for you here.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_418.wav|I grew up listening to these people.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_419.wav|They wanted to show what they could do.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_420.wav|I just want to get rid of it.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_421.wav|Officials say the city must achieve this.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_422.wav|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.|100,,,
wav48/p347/p347_423.wav|I have not come in to take over.|100,,,,
wav48/p347/p347_424.wav|Is this accurate?|100,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_001.wav|Please call Stella.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|101,,
wav48/p351/p351_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|101,,
wav48/p351/p351_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|101,,
wav48/p351/p351_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|101,,
wav48/p351/p351_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|101,,
wav48/p351/p351_025.wav|It was by the numbers.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_026.wav|I don't think they can complain about that.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_027.wav|I have not seen the term immediate.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_028.wav|My Dad is a hero.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_029.wav|It is my fault.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_030.wav|He was the Bill Gates of theatre.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_031.wav|He added, We have the same desire.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_032.wav|Thirty schools were closed in the Western Isles.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_033.wav|As a schoolteacher he was an excellent coach.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_034.wav|Teachers have been given the offer.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_035.wav|We have to win every game.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_036.wav|They also have good neighbours.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_037.wav|Both sides will be aware of this.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_038.wav|They are not advertised.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_039.wav|I have got a wife to feed.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_040.wav|We are getting people into work.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_041.wav|Will we ever play together again?|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_042.wav|What are the barriers?|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_043.wav|He is keen to stay in public service.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_044.wav|Who are the democrats?|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_045.wav|You had to go and see him.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_046.wav|What did you learn in school today?|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_047.wav|We know we can defend it.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_048.wav|That is not the case.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_049.wav|He met his wife and married in England.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_050.wav|Instead we were shot in the back.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_051.wav|This isn't a gimmick.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_052.wav|I won't go back.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_053.wav|There is no signature on this document.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_054.wav|We could not compete with Rangers.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_055.wav|There was mystery back then.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_056.wav|We're all involved in deciding where it goes.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_057.wav|Now it has become a big picture.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_058.wav|The jury is still out.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_059.wav|Hopefully, they will not go through with it.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_060.wav|They have been very lucky with the ice.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_061.wav|We are not the first to be affected.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_062.wav|My players are special.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_063.wav|We are the gateway to justice.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_064.wav|The devil is in the detail.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_065.wav|His handling raises a wider issue.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_066.wav|We have got the school holidays on.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_067.wav|We can't go home.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_068.wav|That just wasn't good enough.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_069.wav|The working families tax credit is far better.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_070.wav|those who are preparing to give up.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_071.wav|It's really good, as long as we play well.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_072.wav|I feel alive and good today.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_073.wav|She was married with one son.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_074.wav|There may be some work in construction, but not enough.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_075.wav|It was a pretty terrible day.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_076.wav|His track record is impressive.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_077.wav|Clearly it is very disturbing.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_078.wav|It is tough, but possible.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_079.wav|This youngster is so exciting!|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_080.wav|I don't understand it.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_081.wav|The band was good, and it's been a great day.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_082.wav|He was rejected because he had retired.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_083.wav|I just wanted to get off the course.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_084.wav|She was also very brave.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_085.wav|He promised a final decision within a fortnight.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_086.wav|Friday night was a pretty good night.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_087.wav|Things are meant to be.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_088.wav|One year later, he finally decided to act.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_089.wav|That doesn't just happen, you have to build it.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_090.wav|This is already happening.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_091.wav|We have a rehearsal.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_092.wav|Four had been brought down.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_093.wav|Only he's not as young as he looks.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_094.wav|The matter is under discussion.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_095.wav|Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.|101,,
wav48/p351/p351_096.wav|Surely this is not supposed to happen?|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_097.wav|This is a defining moment in this parliament.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_098.wav|They have played their part.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_099.wav|They were unable to revive him.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_100.wav|He confirmed that the document was valid.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_101.wav|In part that reflected the times.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_102.wav|That is not true.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_103.wav|Yes, it was too short a night.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_104.wav|I didn't deserve to be sent off.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_106.wav|We have no excuses.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_107.wav|- Really you will !|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_108.wav|The driver was unhurt.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_109.wav|Who will pay for this?|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_110.wav|This is wrong, but it's what is believed.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_111.wav|You have caught a serial killer.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_112.wav|It's all about money, money, money.|101,,
wav48/p351/p351_113.wav|What's the problem?|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_114.wav|Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_115.wav|The way forward isn't going to be easy.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_116.wav|It's the way we go about it.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_117.wav|I will be ridiculed.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_118.wav|There's nothing new in that argument.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_119.wav|This time it was out of the blue.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_120.wav|We need to get the right people in.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_121.wav|It is a great shame.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_122.wav|We were not going to take that risk.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_123.wav|Last night he became one of the hunted.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_124.wav|But that isn't what is worrying the Farmer.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_125.wav|Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_126.wav|In my opinion, it was not working perfectly.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_127.wav|The truth, of course, is very different.|101,,
wav48/p351/p351_128.wav|He has something in common with the Wallabies.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_129.wav|These will take a little time to develop.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_130.wav|I might come back.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_131.wav|He said it was the worst possible result.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_132.wav|But, still, it wasn't working.|101,,
wav48/p351/p351_133.wav|That was my mistake.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_134.wav|We can play better than that.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_135.wav|My whole family is.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_136.wav|However, everyone should do it once in their life.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_137.wav|A career as a doctor is on hold.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_138.wav|During the communist time they were very privileged.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_139.wav|There has been no delay on government orders.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_140.wav|I think we can overcome it.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_141.wav|We will be victorious.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_142.wav|The other question is why the scaling down?|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_143.wav|It was the crowning point of my career.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_144.wav|But it will be sorted out this week.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_145.wav|It's just a fact.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_146.wav|Mr Smith was dismissive.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_147.wav|It was a discussion paper.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_148.wav|My neighbours are horrified.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_149.wav|They will be ready.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_150.wav|Bin Laden is believed to be left-handed.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_151.wav|He is walking free.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_152.wav|There is nothing they can't do.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_153.wav|It certainly was a birthday to remember.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_154.wav|If you can work, you should work.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_155.wav|This was a very tragic accident.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_156.wav|THE Paragon Ensemble is back.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_157.wav|If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_158.wav|It is the voice of the survivors.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_159.wav|The whole thing in general is moving on.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_160.wav|They might also be parlous.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_161.wav|Paterson can afford to be generous.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_162.wav|No other vehicle was involved in the incident.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_163.wav|The other is the existence of male colleagues.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_164.wav|I'm just a piece in the jigsaw.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_165.wav|It is not an escape.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_166.wav|It feels that the game is off.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_167.wav|He is very confident at the moment.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_168.wav|Well, what can you do?|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_169.wav|It is not the message alone.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_170.wav|They will be seen for years to come.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_171.wav|I'm really happy with how things went there.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_172.wav|He will be greatly missed.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_173.wav|Sadly, they don't seem to know.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_174.wav|But is that possible?|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_175.wav|In many ways, that is as important.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_176.wav|I think we're going to make it.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_177.wav|It was really frustrating.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_178.wav|Clubs can only do so much.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_179.wav|Many other areas are coming up.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_180.wav|It would have very little impact on them.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_181.wav|She didn't tell me anything the night before.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_182.wav|That's the way things are heading.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_183.wav|We were extremely poor.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_184.wav|The parties have no contact.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_185.wav|He needed a kidney - it is as simple as that.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_186.wav|We are still paying the price for that.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_187.wav|It was better than a soap opera.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_188.wav|There will be no change in government.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_189.wav|I am just grateful he is alive.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_190.wav|This is a special place for me.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_191.wav|This was a great result for us, a big result.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_192.wav|Our policy is clear.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_193.wav|This was an hour before the show.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_194.wav|It is crucial to understand this in context.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_195.wav|I now know that from memory.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_196.wav|Another one said the couple came from Inverness.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_197.wav|We expect a full house on the night.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_198.wav|He invented the language.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_199.wav|We want to play at the worlds.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_200.wav|We need to know more about her.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_201.wav|I went away to recover fully.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_202.wav|Ownership was the game.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_203.wav|It makes a huge difference.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_204.wav|The man was pronounced dead on arrival.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_205.wav|It's not a new device.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_206.wav|Like everything in Scotland, it takes time.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_207.wav|Six years is too long.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_208.wav|They are not a set of options.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_209.wav|It's a very important and beautiful day.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_210.wav|If only the problems concerned the players.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_211.wav|But it was money well spent.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_212.wav|That's the most important thing for me.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_213.wav|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_214.wav|No decision has yet been made.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_215.wav|I have had a lovely summer.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_216.wav|Which is fair enough.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_217.wav|He took over our lives.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_218.wav|The problem is worse in Scotland.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_219.wav|This is a historic agreement.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_220.wav|He had worked there for only two days.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_221.wav|We just want them home.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_222.wav|His was the best performance of the day, after all.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_223.wav|I was happily surprised.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_224.wav|It may not even be possible.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_225.wav|I think it is a scandal.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_226.wav|Perhaps it was just as well.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_227.wav|That, though, was then.|101,,
wav48/p351/p351_228.wav|I grew up with them.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_229.wav|It was the train coming.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_230.wav|I would have the hammer in the crowd.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_231.wav|We are pursuing legal action against the government.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_232.wav|Perhaps that was their mistake.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_233.wav|We've never seen so many.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_234.wav|The way forward is working with other disciplines.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_235.wav|I am very, very happy.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_236.wav|The case was continued.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_237.wav|That is important for the club.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_238.wav|He is doing the right things.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_239.wav|Blood samples were taken.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_240.wav|Now he is in charge of this.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_241.wav|They want to play in the World Cup.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_242.wav|He was embarrassed about what he did.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_243.wav|This is excellent news for the workforce.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_244.wav|The home team also had their moments.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_245.wav|Haven't been so lucky since.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_246.wav|He is under no illusions.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_247.wav|It got no better.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_248.wav|Some were close to tears.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_249.wav|It has become a way of life.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_250.wav|They seem to turn up for them.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_251.wav|That is a matter for the Scottish Parliament.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_252.wav|Now we are back on top of Europe.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_253.wav|Now the show is for public consumption.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_254.wav|I want to create events.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_255.wav|I wish it wasn't so, but it is.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_256.wav|The old manager, he didn't like me.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_257.wav|We had a court hearing in London yesterday.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_258.wav|The ministers are now to make their decision.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_259.wav|It was like being in prison.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_260.wav|I think it was his parents.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_261.wav|That is very important to people.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_262.wav|I certainly hope not.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_263.wav|This is a dream come true for me.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_264.wav|No other country has ever won this tournament.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_265.wav|There he goes again.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_266.wav|However, there could be more bad weather to come.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_267.wav|I feel pretty good.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_268.wav|It's got to come from me.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_269.wav|There were moments of humour too.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_270.wav|He has a wealth of experience.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_271.wav|Don't you think it was a fine performance?|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_272.wav|It happens from time to time.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_273.wav|All my family are in Scotland, from Glasgow.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_274.wav|They were too hard.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_275.wav|This is not a message from ministers.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_276.wav|We have been very patient.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_277.wav|I don't take that view.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_278.wav|They have a car and cannot afford another.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_279.wav|My only concern is for my children.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_280.wav|This is welcome news.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_281.wav|The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_282.wav|We just wish they had done so before.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_283.wav|It was a virus.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_284.wav|The rest, of course, is history.|101,,
wav48/p351/p351_285.wav|They chose the latter.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_286.wav|That was not the norm.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_287.wav|I've not said anything to them, they know.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_288.wav|It is giving out the wrong message.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_289.wav|I feel it is very irrational.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_290.wav|We were used to being in control.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_291.wav|He's had a lot of injury problems.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_292.wav|Brady lost to Sullivan one hole.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_293.wav|It happened again, and again, and again.|101,,
wav48/p351/p351_294.wav|Does it matter?|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_295.wav|She thought she was going to die.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_296.wav|Were they under-age?|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_297.wav|You are going to go to jail.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_298.wav|It is a very worrying report.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_299.wav|I started it, but then forgot all about it.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_300.wav|My mind was made up.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_301.wav|It was an ongoing exercise.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_302.wav|I would love to see it back there.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_303.wav|He then did just that.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_304.wav|He should have won.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_305.wav|He could hardly have been in greater demand.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_306.wav|Who can predict?|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_307.wav|It was all very proper and civilised.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_308.wav|I've played them all in the Champions League.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_309.wav|Then you see it.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_310.wav|And it had been a marvellous occasion.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_311.wav|We don't believe anything anymore.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_312.wav|Either system could have prevented the crash.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_313.wav|Here, the fans have been fantastic.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_314.wav|There is good quality.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_315.wav|For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_316.wav|But these things are happening now.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_317.wav|He will be really pleased about this.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_318.wav|He had no access to the database.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_319.wav|They were not up to the required standard.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_320.wav|He also seems to have been around forever.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_321.wav|However, it has had only a limited uptake.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_322.wav|At the moment, it is very difficult to know.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_323.wav|Others are expected to do so soon.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_324.wav|They were impressive against France.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_325.wav|Seven people were already in custody in France.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_326.wav|I played well but missed a few chances.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_327.wav|Our approach will be different.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_328.wav|It's my initial background.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_329.wav|The board is currently resolving its differences.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_330.wav|They're just a nonsense.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_331.wav|That has not been the case, as we now know.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_332.wav|He also called in at another farm.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_333.wav|But he seemed to enjoy the challenge.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_334.wav|He will go a long way.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_335.wav|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_336.wav|I lost a part of me.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_337.wav|It's so much more fun.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_338.wav|That's just the kind of thing we have.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_339.wav|It's getting to me.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_340.wav|So we talked about that for a bit.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_341.wav|But he has strong links to Labour.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_342.wav|I am proud of my team.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_343.wav|I am a doctor.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_344.wav|Secondly, there are other options for patients.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_345.wav|It will carry on.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_346.wav|Our season is not over.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_347.wav|I am not retiring.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_348.wav|Money is not everything in life.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_349.wav|She kept him on a string.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_350.wav|It will make a big difference.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_351.wav|There was no basis for their arrest.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_352.wav|This latter suggestion is very important.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_353.wav|The deadline for selecting the electors is today.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_354.wav|The Government has listened.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_355.wav|It's only tackling congestion.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_356.wav|That is a trend which will be encouraged.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_357.wav|It's too horrible to think.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_358.wav|It can be frightening.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_359.wav|He was, but only just.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_360.wav|It may be his last for a while, too.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_361.wav|Further details are expected later.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_362.wav|What's wrong with that?|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_363.wav|You will never forget the clutching horror.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_364.wav|Off with their heads.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_365.wav|I believe she was elected unopposed.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_366.wav|We are not asking for the moon.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_367.wav|Now we see the impact of global politics.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_368.wav|The pain is still acute.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_369.wav|This was not the show for me.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_370.wav|It is a very big problem.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_371.wav|Frustration is not the word.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_372.wav|The police have to act to help them.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_373.wav|The cause is just.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_374.wav|It may be down, but New York is not out.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_375.wav|Our message is getting through.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_376.wav|But what lies ahead?|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_377.wav|She makes me so happy.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_378.wav|They promised to fight the plans.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_379.wav|My heart is not so sure.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_380.wav|I am happy for her.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_381.wav|Finally, he paid for the movie.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_382.wav|They were just too good for us.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_383.wav|He was the architect.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_384.wav|This should include procedures for personal imports.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_385.wav|It's a fantastic achievement.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_386.wav|Neither was in the squad announced yesterday.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_387.wav|Police are appealing for witnesses to the accident.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_388.wav|He, too, was not satisfied.|101,,
wav48/p351/p351_389.wav|It's easy to see why.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_390.wav|But it didn't happen.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_391.wav|All were believed to be adults.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_392.wav|This is the last straw.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_393.wav|The research was my life.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_394.wav|I am so, so, so lucky.|101,,
wav48/p351/p351_395.wav|What is it about this series?|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_396.wav|You read it right.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_397.wav|They would have been forgiven for doing so.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_398.wav|I only wanted to give her a fright.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_399.wav|Where does it come from?|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_400.wav|You find it bizarre?|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_401.wav|I am very excited about this season.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_402.wav|It has proved a double whammy.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_403.wav|Britain hasn't seen it in this way.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_404.wav|It should be a great game, though.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_405.wav|But is he?|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_406.wav|So it's a daily struggle.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_407.wav|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_408.wav|If it's not, they didn't go far enough.|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_409.wav|Ministers are not involved in these discussions.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_410.wav|Everyone has his share of trouble.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_411.wav|You need a licence to run a pub.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_412.wav|Everything else is second.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_413.wav|I am not sure.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_414.wav|This is a successful outcome.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_415.wav|His first album was a hit.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_416.wav|The salary changes are long overdue.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_417.wav|The plane was shaking.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_418.wav|It was visibly on fire.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_419.wav|What's it for, after all?|101,,,
wav48/p351/p351_420.wav|We will be pleased to talk to them.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_421.wav|A number of people could not speak English.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_422.wav|They have got off with murder.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_423.wav|I'm going to take it further.|101,,,,
wav48/p351/p351_424.wav|I kept going for her.|101,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_001.wav|Please call Stella.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|102,,
wav48/p360/p360_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|102,,,
wav48/p360/p360_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|102,,,
wav48/p360/p360_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|102,,
wav48/p360/p360_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|102,,
wav48/p360/p360_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|102,,,
wav48/p360/p360_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|102,,,
wav48/p360/p360_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|102,,,
wav48/p360/p360_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|102,,,
wav48/p360/p360_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|102,,
wav48/p360/p360_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|102,,
wav48/p360/p360_025.wav|You can never take a win for granted.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_026.wav|My conscience is not clear.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_027.wav|Is that it?|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_028.wav|You have been warned.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_029.wav|You are not allowed to do that.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_030.wav|That depends on Rangers.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_031.wav|There are two problems.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_032.wav|Lose, and they would be ridiculed.|102,,,
wav48/p360/p360_033.wav|It's something which is very important to me.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_034.wav|For once he was wrong.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_035.wav|He would not have to explain.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_036.wav|I want to deliver a learning society.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_037.wav|We are just happy that hasn't happened.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_038.wav|I had to be into it.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_039.wav|I'm so grateful for that.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_040.wav|It's not been a good year.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_041.wav|A similar exercise is expected in Scotland.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_042.wav|I have no intention of resigning today.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_043.wav|That has now gone.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_044.wav|Donald is genuine in trying to be inclusive.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_045.wav|This will take up to nine months.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_046.wav|And maybe they have.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_047.wav|Next league matches, Dundee United Rangers.|102,,,
wav48/p360/p360_048.wav|Is he conscious?|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_049.wav|But we are confident.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_050.wav|It is like a football team.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_051.wav|When he came to see me on Monday.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_052.wav|That's a concern to me.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_053.wav|She said she was really sorry.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_054.wav|That will be important.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_055.wav|But here it is also very bad.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_056.wav|That view has not altered.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_057.wav|It was very full anyway.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_058.wav|As for the warning, it was not needed.|102,,,
wav48/p360/p360_059.wav|The incidents are not believed to be linked.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_060.wav|But there is no easy option.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_061.wav|I can't believe she is dead.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_062.wav|No person was charged.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_063.wav|But it would say that.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_064.wav|Most of the works are small in scale.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_065.wav|He was pronounced dead at the scene.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_066.wav|Only the bomber was killed.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_067.wav|But he just carried on anyway.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_068.wav|Nor was it a game without its lessons.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_069.wav|It was that kind of afternoon.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_070.wav|His presence was very important.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_071.wav|What happens next?|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_072.wav|They couldn't believe what had happened.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_073.wav|The bombing begins in five minutes.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_074.wav|That took two weeks.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_075.wav|It's worth it, though.|102,,,
wav48/p360/p360_076.wav|That perhaps is behind the problem.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_077.wav|I have to hand it to the bank.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_078.wav|The question was simple enough.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_079.wav|The voters rejected us.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_080.wav|There was a definite prejudice.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_081.wav|Nothing is going right at the moment.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_082.wav|We never publicise it.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_083.wav|You will be very welcome.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_084.wav|His musicals were very much of their time.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_085.wav|He became enchanted with the process.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_086.wav|This year the exercise is being repeated.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_087.wav|It seems very odd.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_088.wav|They couldn't keep it together.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_089.wav|We discovered that for ourselves.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_090.wav|We will continue to provide support for them.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_091.wav|I've always been very taken by the drink.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_092.wav|It was looking bad.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_093.wav|That's what makes it interesting.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_094.wav|It's nice to be involved.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_095.wav|It's not a game.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_096.wav|Buildings are about people.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_097.wav|There is much work to do.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_098.wav|The release attracted little attention.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_099.wav|It was the dreaded sentence.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_100.wav|I have never considered it.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_101.wav|It is not in the public interest.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_102.wav|They had been forced to walk.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_103.wav|It is harder than you think.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_104.wav|The call was ignored.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_105.wav|I am looking forward to it.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_106.wav|Consumers will also benefit.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_107.wav|That would be even more disastrous.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_108.wav|We opened up and everything was gone.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_109.wav|It is looking very special.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_110.wav|They offered to make an investment into it.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_111.wav|People were hitting the floor.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_112.wav|She was close to suicide at one stage.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_113.wav|They took a risk.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_114.wav|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_115.wav|It has no place in football.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_116.wav|It is frustrating that we cannot do that.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_117.wav|This is a classic.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_118.wav|He played it like a veteran.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_119.wav|I have spoken to head office.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_120.wav|I'm not thinking about anyone else.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_121.wav|They will run a mile.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_122.wav|When she went off it was quite amazing.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_123.wav|Britain has never had it so good.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_124.wav|So many people will be affected by this.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_125.wav|It was all very good stuff.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_126.wav|Or was it?|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_127.wav|We are under no illusions about this.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_128.wav|But they are a good team.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_129.wav|We have a long way to go.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_130.wav|I hope it has helped the prisoners.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_131.wav|Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.|102,,,
wav48/p360/p360_132.wav|I knew that we needed to get out.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_133.wav|I had a train to catch.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_134.wav|And this game is all about belief.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_135.wav|I am ready for that.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_136.wav|It is a fantasy.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_137.wav|The only safe investment is cash.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_138.wav|That's the way they are.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_139.wav|Elections would follow in about two years.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_140.wav|We are trying to be realistic.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_141.wav|That was the theory.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_142.wav|Or so it seemed.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_143.wav|Now we look forward to it.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_144.wav|That was worth it.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_145.wav|What's it going to be then?|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_146.wav|Who was being affected?|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_147.wav|Our players are exhausted.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_148.wav|It is deeply frustrating.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_149.wav|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_150.wav|We've had an enjoyable adventure.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_151.wav|This has been carried out.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_152.wav|Our time is up.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_153.wav|It was a moment of madness.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_154.wav|But other Ministers are not convinced.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_155.wav|First meeting was next week.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_156.wav|No, we were not exactly favourites.|102,,,
wav48/p360/p360_157.wav|Conditions were very difficult for the players.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_158.wav|This solution is not being considered in Scotland.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_159.wav|I didn't think we deserved to go out.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_160.wav|However, we will have to wait and see.|102,,,
wav48/p360/p360_161.wav|I told them they shouldn't say that.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_162.wav|I don't know how they do it.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_163.wav|Little is known about them.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_164.wav|It is a new company for Scotland.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_165.wav|We're very unhappy about it.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_166.wav|A good actor doesn't think.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_167.wav|But the action is about to be restarted.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_168.wav|It was extremely difficult.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_169.wav|It is about the script for me.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_170.wav|I have a good feeling about this.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_171.wav|And the results were impressive.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_172.wav|The next game is today.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_173.wav|Hopefully it will be a good day.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_174.wav|I was a silly bastard.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_175.wav|There is an ongoing problem with this company.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_176.wav|The process will start tomorrow.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_177.wav|Was the punishment excessive?|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_178.wav|The police have an awful lot to explain.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_179.wav|That's when you hope to take advantage.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_180.wav|I could easy do that.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_181.wav|We are really impressed.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_182.wav|I try to be clear in the narrative.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_183.wav|You have to wait.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_184.wav|I did not see anything to begin with.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_185.wav|It's their moment of choice.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_186.wav|I certainly do not agree with that.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_187.wav|It was a disaster of a race.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_188.wav|Only one person can claim the credit.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_189.wav|Maintain the highest standards.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_190.wav|What could we do?|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_191.wav|O Neill has delivered.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_192.wav|But there was no going back.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_193.wav|There are some good people in there.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_194.wav|But it won't make a difference.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_195.wav|I'm not going to blame the band.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_196.wav|I think that he got the message.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_197.wav|Here it was very subdued.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_198.wav|Stardom is a funny thing.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_199.wav|They are protesting, but they know it cannot go on.|102,,,
wav48/p360/p360_200.wav|The atmosphere in the dressing room is superb.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_201.wav|I sincerely hope not.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_202.wav|I'm really looking forward to that.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_203.wav|She would say he was still the best.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_204.wav|It is dangerous and it is a lie.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_205.wav|We didn't, and it worked for us.|102,,,
wav48/p360/p360_206.wav|No-one has used it since then.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_207.wav|The baby was dead.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_208.wav|That remains the unanswered question.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_209.wav|Everyone is too upset to comment.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_210.wav|They tried to give her advice.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_211.wav|We should have no more problems.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_212.wav|Pensions are a long-term investment.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_213.wav|An announcement is expected soon.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_214.wav|It was one of those things.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_215.wav|I can understand that.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_216.wav|But sometimes it was even worse.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_217.wav|We had to work hard for it.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_218.wav|That's a big reduction.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_219.wav|There will be good prospects ahead.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_220.wav|I was pleased about that.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_221.wav|That has not changed.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_222.wav|It's a creative energy.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_223.wav|We are not conducting the review.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_224.wav|It just never comes together.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_225.wav|The club has never won it.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_226.wav|His leader wanted to celebrate.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_227.wav|So it was at Easter Road.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_228.wav|It will be a huge difference.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_229.wav|Labour will almost certainly remain in control.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_230.wav|The characters are always the first attraction.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_231.wav|We've got better players here.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_232.wav|We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_233.wav|This is wonderful news.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_234.wav|So what's it all about?|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_235.wav|I think he was lost for words.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_236.wav|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.|102,,,
wav48/p360/p360_237.wav|I want to celebrate the World Cup.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_238.wav|This is a historic occasion.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_239.wav|No-one expected that their parents would stay.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_240.wav|And what happens?|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_241.wav|It is all very upbeat.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_242.wav|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_243.wav|We're looking for unity in the council.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_244.wav|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_245.wav|We deserved the draw.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_246.wav|Just one of those things, we suppose.|102,,,
wav48/p360/p360_247.wav|It's up to the defence team.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_248.wav|No one was injured.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_249.wav|We have had our debate.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_250.wav|It is part of his game.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_251.wav|Did he just want to be on telly?|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_252.wav|But it was too late.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_253.wav|I didn't see the point.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_254.wav|It seems a shame to leave it.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_255.wav|Who would have thought it?|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_256.wav|They were all on a mission.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_257.wav|Human beings are always the same.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_258.wav|You will gain from that.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_259.wav|It makes me feel difficult.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_260.wav|We couldn't believe it at first.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_261.wav|The distinction is also supported by doctors.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_262.wav|He could still be President.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_263.wav|It can take a long time.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_264.wav|I don't intend to do so now.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_265.wav|There is no answer to it.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_266.wav|He was pleased with his display.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_267.wav|The first time you read a play.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_268.wav|There was no let-up for the minnows.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_269.wav|The bottom line is that this must stop.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_270.wav|He is having a nightmare.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_271.wav|That was six years ago.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_272.wav|Players have to accept this.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_273.wav|He is completely committed to us.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_274.wav|Neither had the public.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_275.wav|It disappeared into the cup.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_276.wav|They might well be right.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_277.wav|I have no further comment to make.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_278.wav|The warning is timely.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_279.wav|Those were the days.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_280.wav|The joint bid is still on course.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_281.wav|A press conference is about politics.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_282.wav|It was important to bring them all together.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_283.wav|We didn't play well and will certainly improve.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_284.wav|They tend to be female and retired.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_285.wav|These things happen in football but shouldn't.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_286.wav|It looks as though he will be right.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_287.wav|We know the fight is going to happen.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_288.wav|I have played well the past two days.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_289.wav|Is it on a building site?|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_290.wav|That is the key.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_291.wav|We've been here before.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_292.wav|I am in a good position.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_293.wav|I have never been unemployed.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_294.wav|We are in it for the long-term.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_295.wav|But it didn't bother me.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_296.wav|I believe it will happen.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_297.wav|And Michael was just great.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_298.wav|He did it well.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_299.wav|Why have you decided to get married?|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_300.wav|Is it all real?|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_301.wav|He will be missed.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_302.wav|I would not descend to that level.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_303.wav|They were not at the property yesterday.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_304.wav|We will not tolerate it.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_305.wav|I'm really proud of her.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_306.wav|What does this mean?|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_307.wav|They are not falling now.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_308.wav|We are not physical at all.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_309.wav|Have we not been here before?|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_310.wav|I've been waiting a long time.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_311.wav|The meaning is very profound and complex.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_312.wav|You just have to get on with it.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_313.wav|The response from everyone was wonderful.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_314.wav|And that match was played in June.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_315.wav|We are looking for Scotland to be inspired.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_316.wav|I don't mean in a frightening way.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_317.wav|He is a sort of a mystery figure.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_318.wav|I have learned a lot.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_319.wav|It won't be their last.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_320.wav|You've got to have both sides.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_321.wav|He has yet to receive a reply.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_322.wav|It has been only average.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_323.wav|He should be worried about me.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_324.wav|Hopefully, it will be good enough.|102,,,
wav48/p360/p360_325.wav|For me, any manager is good.|102,,,
wav48/p360/p360_326.wav|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_327.wav|That was the gimmick.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_328.wav|He refused to name the survivors.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_329.wav|He has changed my life forever.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_330.wav|I have no idea.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_331.wav|This plan is all about respect.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_332.wav|I don't think he played his best.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_333.wav|Pakistan denied the report.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_334.wav|It will be up to the government.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_335.wav|That is a tragedy.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_336.wav|I am very happy.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_337.wav|A child is not a product.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_338.wav|But this is nonsense.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_339.wav|You can't get the experience in Austria.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_340.wav|I'm going to miss it.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_341.wav|There will be no backing down.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_342.wav|The atmosphere was excellent.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_343.wav|That must have had an effect.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_344.wav|They have brought in the replacement.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_345.wav|How did it all come about?|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_346.wav|We are working so hard.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_347.wav|One was a lawyer.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_348.wav|Our position is extremely simple.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_349.wav|Where did that finish?|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_350.wav|I suppose it is quite exciting really.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_351.wav|The most important thing was to win today.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_352.wav|Golf is not like that.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_353.wav|This is a moment to seize.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_354.wav|I would not do that.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_355.wav|Lots of them haven't recovered that far.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_356.wav|They said that they stood by their statement.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_357.wav|That is a trend which will be encouraged.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_358.wav|That has to be allowed.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_359.wav|He has never let them down.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_360.wav|There was no-one of the required standard.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_361.wav|That would be very good for Rangers.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_362.wav|It's something he has worked very hard on.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_363.wav|It is time to fight a decisive battle.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_364.wav|That gives it a spirit.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_365.wav|She has never been back.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_366.wav|It will set the tone.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_367.wav|They are not going away.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_368.wav|Having done it, he was asked again.|102,,,
wav48/p360/p360_369.wav|I think he will.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_370.wav|The package is a changing one.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_371.wav|I'm working on that one, too.|102,,,
wav48/p360/p360_372.wav|Frankly, that's not good enough.|102,,,
wav48/p360/p360_373.wav|Or is it?|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_374.wav|What's the difference?|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_375.wav|The whole family was in shock.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_376.wav|But everywhere the problems are the same.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_377.wav|Craig is a major concern for us.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_378.wav|The problems began a long time ago.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_379.wav|It meant a lot to us.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_380.wav|What other retailer would do this?|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_381.wav|Other musicians were found in retirement.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_382.wav|This country has many challenges.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_383.wav|Their families are gone.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_384.wav|IS Tony Blair on drugs?|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_385.wav|I didn't do it.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_386.wav|They are with their father.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_387.wav|They're all doing it.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_388.wav|I can understand the frustrations of our fans.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_389.wav|No, they are not the same thing.|102,,,
wav48/p360/p360_390.wav|In football it is not always the case.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_391.wav|Sometimes we find a person.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_392.wav|It is a natural reaction.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_393.wav|I am in a very difficult position.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_394.wav|I had to win this race.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_395.wav|They could have been told in advance.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_396.wav|And what do we have?|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_397.wav|It is a relief.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_398.wav|The boat was fantastic.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_399.wav|These were the edited highlights.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_400.wav|That is the difference.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_401.wav|You will need it.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_402.wav|There is so much at stake.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_403.wav|It has great potential.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_404.wav|They had three children.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_405.wav|It was all too little, too late.|102,,,
wav48/p360/p360_406.wav|Still, it is a very good result for us.|102,,,
wav48/p360/p360_407.wav|And he's not alone.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_408.wav|What was all that about?|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_409.wav|What's the problem with change?|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_410.wav|I intend to end it on a high.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_411.wav|What she can't have is the money.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_412.wav|I thought they played well.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_413.wav|This is not the end.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_414.wav|And they went on to win the title.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_415.wav|Now, she will not be running at all.|102,,,
wav48/p360/p360_416.wav|It's not an impression.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_417.wav|This was great for our sport.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_418.wav|There's no place to hide.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_419.wav|I don't think they are too serious.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_420.wav|Tiger is the exception.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_421.wav|There was no happy ending.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_422.wav|They need time to think.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_423.wav|It's unfair on her.|102,,,,
wav48/p360/p360_424.wav|As for Owen, class is permanent.|102,,,
wav48/p361/p361_001.wav|Please call Stella.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|103,,
wav48/p361/p361_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|103,,
wav48/p361/p361_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|103,,
wav48/p361/p361_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|103,,
wav48/p361/p361_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|103,,
wav48/p361/p361_025.wav|Something has to be done.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_026.wav|That is where the damage has been done.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_027.wav|He may not need to force that message.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_028.wav|These decisions are not simple.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_029.wav|The results were very clear.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_030.wav|We must convince the citizens.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_031.wav|I decided it is going to be William.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_032.wav|But we need to keep it there.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_033.wav|It is a case of taking a risk.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_034.wav|I am really ready for it now.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_035.wav|He was jailed for four years.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_036.wav|We felt it was sufficient.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_037.wav|This decision is folly.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_038.wav|And this was well known?|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_039.wav|It took two minutes to respond.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_040.wav|Why you did it will never be known.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_041.wav|He was in his element.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_042.wav|That means an extra two years.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_043.wav|So, we have to go back.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_044.wav|I'm sure he does.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_045.wav|He was found again almost a year later.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_046.wav|The answer was wrong.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_047.wav|They need to be helped.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_048.wav|It is all starting to come together.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_049.wav|I am the fastest player on the course.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_050.wav|It is the tip of the iceberg.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_051.wav|They were taken to prove a point.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_052.wav|It doesn't have to be in Inverness.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_053.wav|It is an important step forward.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_054.wav|A final agreement has not yet been completed.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_055.wav|And they removed a Borderer.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_056.wav|That is the way it is.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_057.wav|That was something else.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_058.wav|This resulted in the following.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_059.wav|I want to deal with this stuff.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_060.wav|We will be patient but we will win.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_061.wav|As good as they come.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_062.wav|It is not for me to say.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_063.wav|For that much we must be grateful.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_064.wav|But the law is very clear on this.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_065.wav|I thought it was quite a positive result.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_066.wav|But we are very near.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_067.wav|Nobody else is at risk.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_068.wav|We are not going to back off.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_069.wav|He said it was for sale.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_070.wav|We have a strong team at the moment.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_071.wav|This is a dream come true.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_072.wav|The problem is not confined to the UK.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_073.wav|It is on the news.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_074.wav|They said there was nothing.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_075.wav|They were looking for things.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_076.wav|I've got to be better than that Quite.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_077.wav|I wouldn't give them a grade.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_078.wav|As it should be.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_079.wav|We have never been short of volunteers.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_080.wav|But who is it?|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_081.wav|Kenny Miller might come through.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_082.wav|Workers will now be balloted on the offer.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_083.wav|It just isn't there.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_084.wav|Drama is not one of them.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_085.wav|And we have a singer.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_086.wav|It was exactly four months away.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_087.wav|This is a personal decision for me.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_088.wav|It's just a failing service.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_089.wav|We all want to be left alone.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_090.wav|I was saying, No.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_091.wav|Where are they?|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_092.wav|I am delighted to hear this news.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_093.wav|I knew him a little.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_094.wav|They just have a go.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_095.wav|If it's going in, it goes in.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_096.wav|Nobody called me to explain.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_097.wav|You didn't get a modified.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_098.wav|What kind of person is he?|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_099.wav|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_100.wav|What has changed since then?|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_101.wav|He knows he is good.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_102.wav|I welcome the decision.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_103.wav|It could take some time.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_104.wav|The girls are so lucky to be alive.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_105.wav|It may be tomorrow - but it may be later.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_106.wav|I've done a lot in that building.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_107.wav|Music is all consuming.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_108.wav|The results are very positive.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_109.wav|Talk of a crisis is absurd.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_110.wav|Which is where we come in.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_111.wav|I'm not looking forward to it.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_112.wav|Next league matches, Aberdeen - Dundee United.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_113.wav|He is a pro.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_114.wav|They have to tell it as it is.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_115.wav|This could easily have been another tragedy.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_116.wav|You should enjoy the day.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_117.wav|He was taken ill in his office.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_118.wav|We couldn't get enough of it.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_119.wav|Cost is a factor, but not the only one.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_120.wav|I am not very pleased.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_121.wav|It is just a statement of fact.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_122.wav|It was on my mind a little bit.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_123.wav|I will just have to be patient.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_124.wav|I didn't think about it again.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_125.wav|And if they fail?|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_126.wav|He has gone through the process before.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_127.wav|Social workers are on stand-by to help.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_128.wav|We've always had something to do.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_129.wav|How do you take them away?|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_130.wav|It will be released in October.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_132.wav|That got me out.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_133.wav|IT is called a killing in the trade.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_134.wav|It's a matter for the Committee.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_135.wav|It will have to ratify the deal.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_136.wav|I've never seen anything like it.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_137.wav|It was highly successful.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_138.wav|We needed someone and we now have him.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_139.wav|It has to find out what went wrong.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_140.wav|Only one was from Glasgow.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_141.wav|I'm sure he will be aware of it.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_142.wav|Until you hit the big games.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_143.wav|They received no money under the merger.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_144.wav|It was a big departure.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_145.wav|She has never mentioned it.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_146.wav|I want my mum.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_147.wav|It seems to have been an own goal.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_148.wav|Or someone wants to say something different.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_149.wav|There are no second chances.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_150.wav|And it was great for me.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_151.wav|I am extremely sad.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_152.wav|This series is for real.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_153.wav|It has still to be recovered.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_154.wav|The conclusion is the same.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_155.wav|I wish they would commit to us.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_156.wav|The driver just insulted me.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_157.wav|Something has to be put in place.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_158.wav|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_159.wav|It's a mixture of everything.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_160.wav|That is the sensible outcome.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_161.wav|You can see the appeal of running away.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_162.wav|This means a lot of hard decisions.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_163.wav|That comes at a cost.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_164.wav|And so did the rest of her team.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_165.wav|He tells the truth and that's important.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_166.wav|Those are difficult decisions.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_167.wav|The omens are not good.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_168.wav|The game was there to be won.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_169.wav|Then there's the casting.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_170.wav|There is no signature.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_171.wav|We can't go on like this.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_172.wav|It is a very demanding course.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_173.wav|Can he do it?|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_174.wav|The quality of life is difficult for them.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_175.wav|I've won the British.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_176.wav|If they wish to go, they can go.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_177.wav|However, it was a different story in the final.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_178.wav|I was just aghast.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_179.wav|They get money for it now.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_180.wav|I could have been offended.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_181.wav|That's not the way to think.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_182.wav|I can see it now.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_183.wav|Then everyone must consider their future.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_184.wav|There was nothing she could do.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_185.wav|We want to be part of it.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_186.wav|It was a bit of a shock.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_187.wav|It's not long enough.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_188.wav|This is positive and welcome.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_189.wav|Now he is back on top again.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_190.wav|Actors like to be in the centre.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_191.wav|Anything less will not do.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_192.wav|Failure is not an option.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_193.wav|That is clearly not happening fast enough.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_194.wav|We were not consulted regarding this appointment.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_195.wav|You look at that.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_196.wav|They will be very physical.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_197.wav|It has been well worth it.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_198.wav|It was just a feeling.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_199.wav|People are trying to run away.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_200.wav|On the face of it, this is excellent news.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_201.wav|This is clearly not abuse.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_202.wav|He should be careful.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_203.wav|Everyone knew the family.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_204.wav|I am prepared to step down.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_205.wav|Translation - we got it wrong.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_206.wav|We will be working on that this week, all right.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_207.wav|These are serious matters.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_208.wav|The pace is telling.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_209.wav|She has always been very friendly.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_210.wav|Their loss is heartbreaking.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_211.wav|It is his script.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_212.wav|I am a socialist.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_213.wav|The response was really good.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_214.wav|The squad is too small.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_215.wav|You can blame the defence.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_216.wav|Usually the enjoyment is two ways.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_217.wav|It just could be a good night.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_218.wav|But we were wrong.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_219.wav|This has gone on too long.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_220.wav|It is an outrage.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_221.wav|It is a performance.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_222.wav|It is the best place.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_223.wav|We tried to get them down.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_224.wav|There were other problems for Brown yesterday.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_225.wav|I don't know the full story.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_226.wav|Part-time staff are being laid off.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_227.wav|Mind you, it wouldn't be a bad idea.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_228.wav|But they have taken the lesson to heart.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_229.wav|I just want him to win a tournament.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_230.wav|Eight others are also believed to have died.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_231.wav|This time, he will be more on the defensive.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_232.wav|I will never see my son again.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_233.wav|But it is being pursued.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_234.wav|He knew they were there.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_235.wav|That would end it for us.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_236.wav|We didn't and it cost us the game.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_237.wav|It attracted no complaints.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_238.wav|Neil is never going to come back.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_239.wav|The years of campaigning have been very difficult.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_240.wav|Four of the victims were women.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_241.wav|He was also very happy to listen.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_242.wav|It's to do with this place.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_243.wav|It's a technical demand.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_244.wav|Sadly it is a mess.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_245.wav|That has to take its toll.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_246.wav|We want to see the maximum of change.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_247.wav|But those days are dead and gone.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_248.wav|However we must not be complacent.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_249.wav|And that was just the start.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_250.wav|Nothing was meant by it.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_251.wav|That was my last game.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_252.wav|Colour is another problem.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_253.wav|It is not just the agencies.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_254.wav|It came in bits and pieces.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_255.wav|You don't see that.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_256.wav|They seem to be, anyway.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_257.wav|I thought they were just excited.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_258.wav|He will appear in court today.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_259.wav|Or is he?|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_260.wav|Was he confident about his prospects?|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_261.wav|What can you do?|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_262.wav|It's been very difficult.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_263.wav|Do something that we need.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_264.wav|There is no other offer on the table.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_265.wav|When she returned, it was a wreck.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_266.wav|Nobody is pushing out to the right.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_267.wav|It is difficult to say.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_268.wav|He is not the only one.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_269.wav|We call it marriage.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_270.wav|Full back was a bit of the unknown.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_271.wav|It's not the tour.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_272.wav|So what is the secret of the success?|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_273.wav|My husband was fighting for his life.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_274.wav|So was the first half.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_275.wav|It is still under discussion with the board.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_276.wav|That is one point of view.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_277.wav|We are in this for the long haul.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_278.wav|Here we go then.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_279.wav|No reason was given.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_280.wav|I can't wait for it to come out.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_281.wav|I am really sorry that he is going.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_282.wav|Indeed, that has already begun.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_283.wav|But it's the truth.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_284.wav|We have been here before.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_285.wav|And he did that.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_286.wav|And she is very clear on this.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_287.wav|His remarks were disgraceful.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_288.wav|I did not think it was very proper.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_289.wav|I have really noticed that this week.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_290.wav|In a way he was.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_291.wav|I will never forget that.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_292.wav|It was considered to be topical.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_293.wav|Well, that's all right then.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_294.wav|No-one is a winner in this.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_295.wav|Who wants to be a millionaire?|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_296.wav|What do you think?|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_297.wav|They went back to the seventeenth.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_298.wav|If we don't do it, someone else will.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_299.wav|Again, there was no detail.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_300.wav|Let the voters decide.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_301.wav|Then it will come.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_302.wav|It should be easy.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_303.wav|Is it worth it?|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_304.wav|I will build a house on the site.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_305.wav|We are right at the heart of Europe.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_306.wav|I do my job.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_307.wav|They have to get that sorted.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_308.wav|That is a dangerous assumption.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_309.wav|Does it make a profit?|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_310.wav|I think it's a good sign.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_311.wav|A winter of discontent awaits.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_312.wav|I knew him well.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_313.wav|I am not ready to walk away.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_314.wav|Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_315.wav|They are already there.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_316.wav|I'd never given up on myself.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_317.wav|The concerns were unfounded.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_318.wav|It doesn't look good for her.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_319.wav|It was a management problem in the hospital.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_320.wav|I have some comments.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_321.wav|You have to be realistic.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_322.wav|There was nowhere for him to go.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_323.wav|Not that he was complaining.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_324.wav|We are very proud of him.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_325.wav|There they were, making excuses for him.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_326.wav|It just got out of control.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_327.wav|Every case is completely different.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_328.wav|It's all about unfinished business.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_329.wav|Our own people are coming over on Friday.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_330.wav|In Scotland, there should be vigilance.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_331.wav|It will be fine.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_332.wav|Yet the job is far from over.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_333.wav|He has a point.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_334.wav|He should emerge as the winner.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_335.wav|It is our other home.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_336.wav|When you think you cannot go on, you can.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_337.wav|What a difference a game can make.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_338.wav|It is their day.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_339.wav|They are a very good side, without a doubt.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_340.wav|They are used to it.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_341.wav|And we are doing it.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_342.wav|It's just not good enough.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_343.wav|I have a cold.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_344.wav|You've got to hand it to them.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_345.wav|Next League matches, Aberdeen - Dundee.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_346.wav|It was his own decision.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_347.wav|This is still happening in the US.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_348.wav|And that was the real problem.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_349.wav|But then the problems began.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_350.wav|It wasn't about her singing, though.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_351.wav|From the opening Could It Be Magic?|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_352.wav|The duties are still to be drawn up.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_353.wav|That there would be discussions.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_354.wav|It must not happen.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_355.wav|That would be unsafe.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_356.wav|I did not go looking anywhere else.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_357.wav|We had no idea what was going on.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_358.wav|If only it had been.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_359.wav|So far, it is no more.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_360.wav|Seven people were critically injured.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_361.wav|I am very sorry to be here.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_362.wav|He could have given them a lot.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_363.wav|It was up to him.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_364.wav|It's going to happen.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_365.wav|I don't think so.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_366.wav|And that was just about that.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_367.wav|By hard work, is the answer.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_368.wav|It is really special to me.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_369.wav|This is a major step forward.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_370.wav|They haven't got the uniform.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_371.wav|Well, you don't have time.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_372.wav|It is very funny.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_373.wav|I just hope it's not tonight against us.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_374.wav|This is good news for the industry.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_375.wav|There are no quick fixes.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_376.wav|Because they didn't want to know.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_377.wav|What do we have to do?|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_378.wav|I have never seen anything like it.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_379.wav|It's about New Yorkers.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_380.wav|That was a real challenge.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_381.wav|They will give it a couple of years.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_382.wav|He certainly would have approved.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_383.wav|Conditions were less than ideal.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_384.wav|We want this place to work.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_385.wav|Father is on the train.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_386.wav|It could have been prevented.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_387.wav|We have been going for three years.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_388.wav|Firstly, we don't know we can do this.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_389.wav|I think it was entirely the right decision.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_390.wav|It is planned for London in the spring.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_391.wav|Everything is coming together well.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_392.wav|They would have to go to the Royal.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_393.wav|But we are not afraid of them.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_394.wav|It didn't matter who was in their way.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_395.wav|That will be the criteria for the future.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_396.wav|They thought they couldn't get any.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_397.wav|He was too good for me - too consistent.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_398.wav|I am delighted to have her back home.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_399.wav|This idea is a good starting point.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_400.wav|She had denied the charge.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_401.wav|It was cynical and callous.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_402.wav|It's a dead end.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_403.wav|What sort of man is that?|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_404.wav|The message was clear.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_405.wav|We are going nowhere.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_406.wav|It is truly masterly performance.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_407.wav|She failed to win any of them.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_408.wav|It is believed he had been stabbed.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_409.wav|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_410.wav|It has a rally instead of a conference.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_411.wav|I found that we couldn't.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_412.wav|He is very sensitive.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_413.wav|That can benefit the larger companies.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_414.wav|I am still waiting for a reply.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_415.wav|We told them in July.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_416.wav|This was a very tragic accident.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_417.wav|We are very, very confident.|103,,,
wav48/p361/p361_418.wav|It is a result we should savour.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_419.wav|Everyone in Britain is proud of this team.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_420.wav|We certainly do not intend to disband.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_421.wav|My life is going to go on.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_422.wav|It's really part of our mission.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_423.wav|That was only the start.|103,,,,
wav48/p361/p361_424.wav|But what took them so long?|103,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_001.wav|Please call Stella.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|104,,
wav48/p362/p362_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|104,,
wav48/p362/p362_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|104,,
wav48/p362/p362_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|104,,
wav48/p362/p362_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|104,,
wav48/p362/p362_025.wav|We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_026.wav|This is your country.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_027.wav|Yesterday's performance was exactly that.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_028.wav|I feel really good.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_029.wav|It was a fairy tale.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_030.wav|But there are no plans.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_031.wav|They responded in the most positive way.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_032.wav|I have a very strong opinion about this.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_033.wav|The British government said she was coming home.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_034.wav|We are a peaceful people.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_035.wav|His mother was English.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_036.wav|He was jailed for five years.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_037.wav|It's not Big Brother at sea.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_038.wav|Was this a new event?|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_039.wav|To beat the European champion is quite nice.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_040.wav|They had a confession.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_041.wav|As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminster Hall.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_042.wav|The chances were plentiful.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_043.wav|They were impressive against France.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_044.wav|This is only one example.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_045.wav|His style is suited to Scottish football.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_046.wav|The cause is just.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_047.wav|I am so upset.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_048.wav|England could not take anything for granted, however.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_049.wav|They finished second and third.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_050.wav|But this was refused.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_051.wav|Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_052.wav|Hasn't let anyone down?|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_053.wav|We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_054.wav|We certainly hope we have been successful.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_055.wav|He is one of them.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_056.wav|This was no accident.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_057.wav|He is a law unto himself.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_058.wav|It is a sign of hope.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_059.wav|With him are the symbols of his faith.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_060.wav|They're interested only in profits.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_061.wav|And there has been a good start.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_062.wav|I feel my parents are in New York.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_063.wav|Policing the profession is important.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_064.wav|Seems a sensible compromise.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_065.wav|She had no chance.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_066.wav|In the meantime, you just have to get on with it.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_067.wav|I don't have a problem with it.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_068.wav|How is he enjoying life as a senior?|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_069.wav|It's more relaxing this way.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_070.wav|Allison is not convinced.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_071.wav|We have to move forward from now on.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_072.wav|And it was this one.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_073.wav|I am going to win the next two.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_074.wav|She's afraid of life.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_075.wav|But there is good and bad.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_076.wav|The real problem is the Usher Hall.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_077.wav|That is her job.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_078.wav|They have broken that promise.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_079.wav|I don't know what it means.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_080.wav|I found the course inspiring.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_081.wav|I have to accept that.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_082.wav|It means the margin for error is tight.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_083.wav|I thought he was part of the camera.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_084.wav|She is now on the back benches.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_085.wav|It is not a road of life.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_086.wav|Three bystanders were killed.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_087.wav|One is investment, one is reform.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_088.wav|They could not have done more for me.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_089.wav|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_090.wav|It benefits the whole family.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_091.wav|It's not my fault.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_092.wav|My husband was angry.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_093.wav|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_094.wav|Instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_095.wav|Sure, this is a very important event for me.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_096.wav|They have to work so hard.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_097.wav|Well, was it?|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_098.wav|I thought he was my friend.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_099.wav|What kind of person is he?|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_100.wav|There's a strong involvement.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_101.wav|This is complete nonsense.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_102.wav|This Government is cutting taxes.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_103.wav|The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_104.wav|They know their son was murdered.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_105.wav|Most of them were one-year conscripts.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_106.wav|So is that it, then?|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_107.wav|The task is enormous.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_108.wav|I know he meant it.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_109.wav|A, The media has been great.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_110.wav|There have been so many.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_111.wav|Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_112.wav|Of course, it is nonsense.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_113.wav|I've never felt affection for Emu.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_114.wav|He had returned to die.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_115.wav|Anyone can take a photo.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_116.wav|He is involved in everything.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_117.wav|No person was charged.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_118.wav|You see, my back has gone.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_119.wav|He's a nice guy.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_120.wav|The fire was still coming down.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_121.wav|It's always the way.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_122.wav|I got the surprise of my life.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_123.wav|It will be tight.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_124.wav|He seems to be used to the attention.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_125.wav|Both are national treasures.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_126.wav|I accept that, but it is very upsetting.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_127.wav|Well, you don't have time.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_128.wav|I had never done anything like it before.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_129.wav|I feel it's time to make the switch.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_130.wav|But he thought the overall results were good.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_131.wav|Stewart will travel with some confidence.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_132.wav|I had been hoping for justice.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_133.wav|Labour is providing none of these.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_134.wav|The building was starting to come down.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_135.wav|No other vehicle was involved in the crash.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_136.wav|There is enormous interest in Scotland the Brand.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_137.wav|There is a subtle difference.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_138.wav|He has created the confusion.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_139.wav|He didn't get out much.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_140.wav|She was very different.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_141.wav|That is my dream.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_142.wav|Off-duty nurses were called in at Ayr.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_143.wav|The problem is not confined to Glasgow.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_144.wav|Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_145.wav|The choice is simple.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_146.wav|Who is going to pay their wages?|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_147.wav|I don't think we deserved to lose.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_148.wav|It was that kind of match.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_149.wav|We couldn't believe it at first.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_150.wav|Feel the air, the space.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_151.wav|I have nothing to regret.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_152.wav|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_153.wav|A century on, little has changed.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_154.wav|Wrong decisions Address in full|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_155.wav|I asked to take it up to Glasgow.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_156.wav|He is having a nightmare.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_157.wav|And he still is.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_158.wav|However, the story has a happy ending.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_159.wav|You never had it so good.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_160.wav|Even for a British Open, this is different.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_161.wav|Then he did it twice.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_162.wav|So is the rest of British sport.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_163.wav|Genetic assessment is crucial.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_164.wav|It was his greatest movie performance.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_165.wav|We go back a long way.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_166.wav|So, easy does it.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_167.wav|Not that he's declined.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_168.wav|People also have trouble with the currency.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_169.wav|I always wanted her to be happy.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_170.wav|We've got to get back to normal.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_171.wav|Do we want to see it?|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_172.wav|That is for certain.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_173.wav|An inquiry has begun.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_174.wav|I was a little surprised.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_175.wav|That is not, however, the case.|104,,
wav48/p362/p362_176.wav|Only two players have done it.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_177.wav|He is a master of deceit and delay.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_178.wav|He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_179.wav|What was that all about?|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_180.wav|This is a fine appointment.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_181.wav|That was the finest moment in my career.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_182.wav|England will be quite prepared.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_183.wav|He is appealing to women.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_184.wav|There is no conflict of interest.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_185.wav|She has the biggest part.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_186.wav|Film music was never the same again.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_187.wav|It was a deeply moving musical experience.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_188.wav|I thought he was at fault.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_189.wav|The First Minister is an addict.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_190.wav|We will win this tie.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_191.wav|I think he's done it a few times.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_192.wav|Something happened on that island.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_193.wav|This is a business.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_194.wav|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.|104,,
wav48/p362/p362_195.wav|I never had any real direction at school.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_196.wav|That's how it works.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_197.wav|It is quite a young team, so the future is there.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_198.wav|Do what you want to do.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_199.wav|We know the quality of life goes up.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_200.wav|Who are the public?|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_201.wav|When it is ready, it will be signed.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_203.wav|But we have learned that it doesn't.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_204.wav|I'm looking forward to coming home.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_205.wav|They should not be blamed for it.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_206.wav|He is, indeed, the grandson of travelling folk.|104,,
wav48/p362/p362_207.wav|Glasgow is a very welcoming place.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_208.wav|It was crucial strike.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_209.wav|I have no secrets.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_210.wav|What do you want to say?|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_211.wav|I was so relieved.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_212.wav|They continue to do so.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_213.wav|I think that's a bit of an invasion.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_214.wav|It is a worry.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_215.wav|We are not a retailer, we provide a service.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_216.wav|That is highly unfair.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_217.wav|They are not the answer to staff shortages.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_218.wav|Gas is too expensive.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_219.wav|This plan is an agenda for action.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_220.wav|It was all relative.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_221.wav|And, within itself, it is visionary.|104,,
wav48/p362/p362_222.wav|Are you up for business?|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_223.wav|It is true, but it is only part of the issue.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_224.wav|You are not in any kind of trouble.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_225.wav|It also makes for interesting viewing.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_226.wav|Life becomes a song.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_227.wav|No wonder he missed the conversion.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_228.wav|Sadly, they did not.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_229.wav|We have nowhere to go.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_230.wav|He has every right to do that.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_231.wav|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.|104,,
wav48/p362/p362_232.wav|That had never happened.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_233.wav|However, our players will fight for that.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_234.wav|They are not suitable.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_235.wav|He is advised that he has done so.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_236.wav|You mean he didn't get the girl?|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_237.wav|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_238.wav|The Prime Minister has been in touch.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_239.wav|But the killing will continue.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_240.wav|They've got to get better.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_241.wav|But we are working together for this result.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_242.wav|Mental health is a massive issue.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_243.wav|It doesn't make them evil.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_244.wav|We don't want to be too intrusive.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_245.wav|The most important thing is the game.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_246.wav|He said nothing of the sort.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_247.wav|This would give Scotland around eight members.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_248.wav|In saying that, you just have to get on with it.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_249.wav|The door is open.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_250.wav|Pulled a huge number of viewers.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_251.wav|Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_252.wav|Lara is very, very much a girl.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_253.wav|So what went wrong?|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_254.wav|We did not play well.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_255.wav|We are in a very strong position.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_256.wav|This will have no effect on the championship.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_257.wav|That is the key.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_258.wav|So, how did you do?|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_259.wav|Well, until recently he didn't think so.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_260.wav|It was, however, the wrong side.|104,,
wav48/p362/p362_261.wav|I can't deny that fact.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_262.wav|She is now planning a visit.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_263.wav|We could have done without this.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_264.wav|Boy is the town a mess.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_265.wav|Substantial pockets of resistance remain.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_266.wav|He's a great dealer.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_267.wav|Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.|104,,
wav48/p362/p362_268.wav|I want to concentrate on the real issues.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_269.wav|He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_270.wav|We are moving on.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_271.wav|This is not a crisis.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_272.wav|There's always a chance.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_273.wav|I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_274.wav|For me, it's a tension you can feel.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_275.wav|For some, it might not make too much difference.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_276.wav|That's a very serious matter.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_277.wav|They have a way of proclaiming themselves.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_278.wav|But it was to no avail.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_279.wav|Sad to say, it's still waiting.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_280.wav|It has been a major success.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_281.wav|It takes a bit of working out.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_282.wav|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_283.wav|But it didn't bother me.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_284.wav|I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_285.wav|I'm very relaxed about that indeed.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_286.wav|He will not be coming back.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_287.wav|He is also a great finisher.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_288.wav|I don't see any problem.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_289.wav|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_290.wav|Yet it seemed to work.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_291.wav|Let us hope it doesn't come to that.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_292.wav|I have never felt so well.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_293.wav|There are other things going on.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_294.wav|All is now forgiven.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_295.wav|So who is right?|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_296.wav|And this tournament will travel.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_297.wav|There will be new memories.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_298.wav|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_299.wav|We know the goals will come.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_300.wav|How can they get one?|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_301.wav|It was an insult.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_302.wav|But we all have to look at ourselves.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_303.wav|We have nothing to hide.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_304.wav|He added, We are full of anger.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_305.wav|He did it all for us.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_306.wav|I don't think that is good enough.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_307.wav|Of course it is.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_308.wav|We all make mistakes.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_309.wav|It was published yesterday on the internet.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_310.wav|That is my commitment.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_311.wav|This is the only problem with the story.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_312.wav|It is good football in Scotland.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_313.wav|Knowledge is everything at this level.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_314.wav|Is that right?|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_315.wav|So other options had to be explored.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_316.wav|They should be so lucky.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_317.wav|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_318.wav|It is good news for us.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_319.wav|The timing is obvious.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_320.wav|He's a good player, but he's not the only one.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_321.wav|Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_322.wav|I don't think it's very real.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_323.wav|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_324.wav|I think she was right.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_325.wav|Is that what people want?|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_326.wav|CHRISTMAS is special, a time for reflection.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_327.wav|I'd like to continue that record.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_328.wav|It will be a new experience.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_329.wav|The process itself has taken over.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_330.wav|She asked for the appointment with me.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_331.wav|The time commitment is the biggest thing.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_332.wav|It is quite hard to track.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_333.wav|It's not going to last five minutes.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_334.wav|But his attendance is not guaranteed.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_335.wav|Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_336.wav|I am sure all schools would accept that.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_337.wav|It was quite an ordeal for them.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_338.wav|There are a number of possible outcomes.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_339.wav|Doesn't matter what you do.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_340.wav|O no it's not!|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_341.wav|The result could be all down to turnout.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_342.wav|They are in good spirits.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_343.wav|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_344.wav|He was their leader.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_345.wav|The support of Britain is assumed.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_346.wav|So far he has not done so.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_347.wav|Maybe they will show it next year.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_348.wav|They are a very good team.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_349.wav|So there we are.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_350.wav|And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_351.wav|It doesn't make me feel any better.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_352.wav|The conversion didn't go over either.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_353.wav|The incident is dead.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_354.wav|We are delighted with the result.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_355.wav|It will take time.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_356.wav|They will do something big.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_357.wav|The programme was awful.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_358.wav|It is having a big impact.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_359.wav|That is very hard, alone.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_360.wav|I am feeling on top of the world.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_361.wav|Doesn't he miss it?|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_362.wav|The same goes for Russia.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_363.wav|They went down together.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_364.wav|Cooking is intricate and complex.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_365.wav|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.|104,,
wav48/p362/p362_366.wav|We were getting very worried.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_367.wav|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.|104,,
wav48/p362/p362_368.wav|You can't really compare.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_369.wav|We thought we were looking in good shape.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_370.wav|Plot is not the issue.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_371.wav|We need to increase the membership.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_372.wav|Certainly, there is much on the agenda.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_373.wav|We should not be complacent.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_374.wav|We all want the same things.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_375.wav|Maybe his time has gone.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_376.wav|She died in hospital two hours later.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_377.wav|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_378.wav|SO, that is it for another year.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_379.wav|The results are tragic.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_380.wav|We are not getting him back.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_381.wav|He was on a horse.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_382.wav|Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_383.wav|I told her, and she was extremely grateful.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_384.wav|There may be reasons for it.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_385.wav|He had taken everything from me.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_386.wav|It's a good offer by any standards.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_387.wav|Yes, it took time to recover.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_388.wav|The potential is always in the idea.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_389.wav|I am not a frustrated actor.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_390.wav|No progress has been made.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_391.wav|He can win every week.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_392.wav|This makes up for it.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_393.wav|My mind was made up.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_394.wav|The plot is changing as time goes on.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_395.wav|I never got anything out of it.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_396.wav|It is patently true.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_397.wav|Locate in Scotland also refused to comment.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_398.wav|But don't just take my word, for it.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_399.wav|That is why he is so special.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_400.wav|You hope he prevails.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_401.wav|My mother was getting on at me.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_402.wav|This is a very serious matter.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_403.wav|It's going to be great!|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_404.wav|That's a good sign.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_405.wav|I'd never heard anything like it before.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_406.wav|He added that he felt undermined.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_407.wav|Hopefully, it will be good enough.|104,,,
wav48/p362/p362_408.wav|He declined to be more specific.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_409.wav|But it looks good for next year.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_410.wav|Figures are not relevant to the strategy.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_411.wav|We want everyone to have a good time.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_412.wav|We're going to rebuild.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_413.wav|We are trying to do it properly.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_414.wav|We actually had a laugh about that.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_415.wav|It raises the edge.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_416.wav|He is wanted by German police for questioning.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_417.wav|I had no idea.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_418.wav|As indeed it did.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_419.wav|We made a world record together.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_420.wav|They were outside the circle.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_421.wav|I want to help other women.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_422.wav|He got the part.|104,,,,
wav48/p362/p362_423.wav|Or, rather, it isn't.|104,,
wav48/p362/p362_424.wav|He refused to name the survivors.|104,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_001.wav|Please call Stella.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|105,,
wav48/p363/p363_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|105,,
wav48/p363/p363_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|105,,
wav48/p363/p363_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|105,,
wav48/p363/p363_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|105,,
wav48/p363/p363_025.wav|It's never been to committee.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_026.wav|Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_027.wav|It was actually very, very difficult.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_028.wav|The proposals were not new.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_029.wav|He scored one goal and was on fire.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_030.wav|His party never arrived.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_031.wav|Visitors are directed instantly to the shop.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_032.wav|If that is the case, it is a breakthrough.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_033.wav|He gave no other details.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_034.wav|It's not an improvement for him.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_035.wav|I think it is wide open.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_036.wav|It certainly is cause for concern.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_037.wav|It's on with a roller.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_038.wav|The captaincy will help that, too.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_039.wav|That's probably the hard bit about being dropped.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_040.wav|I think we're a long way forward.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_041.wav|The impact was immediate.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_042.wav|There is a new confidence about the club.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_043.wav|His film is not.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_044.wav|It is the strength of the school.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_045.wav|In my experience, he does not do that.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_046.wav|That is good news.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_047.wav|This has come as a shock to everyone.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_048.wav|He will never be forgotten.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_049.wav|I was not overly concerned about this.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_050.wav|He was very grateful for his health.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_051.wav|The nation has his music.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_052.wav|But real life is not like that.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_053.wav|So now we know.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_054.wav|That is why this action has been taken.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_055.wav|Who will pay for this?|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_056.wav|The defender should have won the bloody ba.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_057.wav|There has been a reduction in cleaning standards.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_058.wav|We were upset about the referee.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_059.wav|That is our objective.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_060.wav|What's the problem?|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_061.wav|He is not alone.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_062.wav|He did that last Sunday.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_063.wav|There wasn't anything in it.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_064.wav|The club is afflicted by injuries.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_065.wav|Sentencing is also being considered in that review.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_066.wav|Lovely day isn't it?|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_067.wav|It was far from business as usual.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_068.wav|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_069.wav|The show is not over.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_070.wav|Saddam Hussein is a devil.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_071.wav|This is a judgment issue.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_072.wav|Thirty people have applied for his job!|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_073.wav|It was just an accident.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_074.wav|We are not commenting at the moment.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_075.wav|Today we must not repeat that mistake.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_076.wav|Somebody should have noticed that something was wrong.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_077.wav|He is slightly confused.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_078.wav|We did not deserve to go through.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_079.wav|The course has helped a lot.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_080.wav|All the time, that number was coming down and down.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_081.wav|There is room for me.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_082.wav|That can only be a good thing.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_083.wav|I have never seen anything like this.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_084.wav|They are difficult awards to decide.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_085.wav|It was that kind of war.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_086.wav|That is my preference.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_087.wav|He later told The Herald, It is true.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_088.wav|It has come a long way since then.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_089.wav|It was decided he should be dismissed.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_090.wav|But someone has got to do it.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_091.wav|We have not given up.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_092.wav|It was the turning point of the afternoon.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_093.wav|I'd never be satisfied with just the relay.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_094.wav|What has happened?|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_095.wav|If they are not, the commission will take action.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_096.wav|Where will the money come from?|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_097.wav|She is still very poorly.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_098.wav|It was good fun.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_099.wav|This is a great shame.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_100.wav|We talk about effective military action.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_101.wav|I can't get it.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_102.wav|It was entirely justified.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_103.wav|He demanded to speak to the boss.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_104.wav|It's somewhere in between.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_105.wav|The play was to go straight ahead.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_106.wav|He had never run the distance before.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_107.wav|I am the head.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_108.wav|He is obviously very dangerous.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_109.wav|It can be very worrying.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_110.wav|It's harder, believe me.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_111.wav|We are making no comment.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_112.wav|I sit at home a lot.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_113.wav|That was certainly the case for the parties.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_114.wav|I hope the couples are still together.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_115.wav|We have learned a tremendous amount.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_116.wav|But that is not enough.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_117.wav|These people are helpless.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_118.wav|I wish him well.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_119.wav|Only the details have to be sorted out.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_120.wav|It would be really interesting if they did.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_121.wav|That takes a lot of courage.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_122.wav|Sadly, it is not to be.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_123.wav|Motorists will welcome this.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_124.wav|I welcome this Bill.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_125.wav|This is not a problem.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_126.wav|he announced his plans.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_127.wav|He is the man to beat.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_128.wav|We are getting not a penny.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_129.wav|Look at the turn-out.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_130.wav|Which brings us to the question of money.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_131.wav|It is very simple.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_132.wav|There was something special about that.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_133.wav|Many other areas are coming up.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_134.wav|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_135.wav|There were no reports of casualties.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_136.wav|But it's a subtle process.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_137.wav|She didn't tell me anything the night before.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_138.wav|I will be having talks with the workforce.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_139.wav|Changes need to be made.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_140.wav|Things are going well.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_141.wav|Hard it will be.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_142.wav|I was deeply worried.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_143.wav|Maybe it will work there.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_144.wav|How does it all work?|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_145.wav|We could easily have lost that game.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_146.wav|There's a lot of it going on.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_147.wav|I doubt it would be genuine.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_148.wav|It would be a masterclass.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_149.wav|It would have been a very explosive issue.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_150.wav|I didn't really expect to be called up.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_151.wav|They will not be going back.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_152.wav|The progress has been steady.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_153.wav|It has no chance.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_154.wav|His body was never found.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_155.wav|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_156.wav|We have been extremely busy.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_157.wav|It appears to have been successful.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_158.wav|This is a big game for them.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_159.wav|We still have to wait for that.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_160.wav|He said it was his greatest work.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_161.wav|I feel a little betrayed.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_162.wav|The baby deserves the credit.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_163.wav|I live for today.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_164.wav|I have been very stupid.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_165.wav|I always savour the company of The Voice.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_166.wav|My father and mother are.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_167.wav|But that was his nature.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_168.wav|We have been together for five years.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_169.wav|They would never let him go.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_170.wav|So what's in store?|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_171.wav|He didn't know where to look.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_172.wav|The German had a point to make.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_173.wav|There are two characters.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_174.wav|The only trouble is finding them.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_175.wav|Scotland won by six wickets.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_176.wav|Her body has never been found.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_177.wav|It is all credit to them today.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_178.wav|That was a huge experience.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_179.wav|Perhaps it was just as well.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_180.wav|Will he be here for the weekend?|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_181.wav|He can do everything.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_182.wav|Now is the time for action.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_183.wav|Public safety is paramount.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_184.wav|I feel really confident in that department.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_185.wav|They were not consulted.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_186.wav|He had an apartment ready.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_187.wav|The prime minister will make the decision.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_188.wav|THERE's only one word for it.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_189.wav|We're trying to get rounded performers.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_190.wav|It was far more important than that.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_191.wav|That is European law.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_192.wav|Gary Parker is a favourite of mine.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_193.wav|Their appeal will be heard this week.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_194.wav|Their own instinctive response was confirmed.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_195.wav|Why is he not fighting for the Union?|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_196.wav|A decision is expected tomorrow.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_197.wav|I wanted to get on with it.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_198.wav|I don't think it's the area.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_199.wav|Well, you might have a point.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_200.wav|It was a horrible moment.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_201.wav|It was quite distressing for the crew.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_202.wav|Tomorrow we begin again as New Yorkers.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_203.wav|I really had to concentrate.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_204.wav|We didn't want any trouble.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_205.wav|Frankly, they have to crack down.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_206.wav|The training will take place in Downing Street.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_207.wav|We have still got the fight in us.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_208.wav|That decision is now being appealed.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_209.wav|This is really good news for us.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_210.wav|I wanted to have a go.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_211.wav|A senior party insider said.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_212.wav|We got on very well.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_213.wav|I think it must be the uniforms.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_214.wav|This is not a monument to the past.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_215.wav|We can all understand that.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_216.wav|You are going to have to do it.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_217.wav|I was amazed at her knowledge.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_218.wav|Where is the evidence?|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_219.wav|It was important in training terms.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_220.wav|Ours is on for two days.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_221.wav|We don't want that at all.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_222.wav|Her appeal is to be heard this week.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_223.wav|The group will report back in the summer.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_224.wav|Among them is his beloved teacher.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_225.wav|We don't come here for our health.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_226.wav|That in itself is a joke.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_227.wav|They know nothing about the sport.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_228.wav|But we shall have to talk to him.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_229.wav|Well, we know now.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_230.wav|He was only doing his job.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_231.wav|They chose the latter.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_232.wav|The legal process could last weeks.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_233.wav|All were later allowed home.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_234.wav|I can do this on my own.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_235.wav|Will you just put it away?|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_236.wav|I think it's more important to have fun.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_237.wav|By then it was too late.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_238.wav|I am very sorry to hear about this.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_239.wav|I'm so looking forward to it.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_240.wav|I think we can do well.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_241.wav|That ignorance is crucial.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_242.wav|It was an excellent performance.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_243.wav|It is also claimed that he was murdered.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_244.wav|Clearly, there was a mix-up.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_245.wav|I have not had much of him.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_246.wav|Sub Not Used, MacKay.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_247.wav|We are taking no chances this time.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_248.wav|He is to be commended.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_249.wav|I can hardly believe it.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_250.wav|The goals will come.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_251.wav|I don't feel like working.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_252.wav|Then one day it happened.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_253.wav|I sit in the car.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_254.wav|We stopped at half-time.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_255.wav|I was brought up in a mining background.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_256.wav|All winners should be tested.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_257.wav|We would like to see them in court.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_258.wav|I thought his speech was a disgrace.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_259.wav|It is not a soap opera.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_260.wav|Whatever we do, we know we can do well.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_261.wav|They may not always be so lucky.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_262.wav|Where was the point in all this?|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_263.wav|He was travelling to see his daughter.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_264.wav|It's an hour of the same response.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_265.wav|This is the root of their problems.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_266.wav|Two other men have recovered.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_267.wav|It will be a challenging film.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_268.wav|The test case is still awaiting action.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_269.wav|She is under police escort.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_270.wav|However, that is not in itself enough.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_271.wav|That should not be their conclusion.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_272.wav|We're going to fight it.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_273.wav|The plot is minimal.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_274.wav|His funeral is not expected until next week.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_275.wav|Now we have had enough.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_276.wav|Can you believe it?|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_277.wav|He is certainly not looking for another job.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_278.wav|I have a problem with these things.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_280.wav|The gap is closing.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_281.wav|Then there was her childhood.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_282.wav|Other people had looked at it.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_283.wav|And the other winners are.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_284.wav|It was quite a sight.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_285.wav|But he was far from alone.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_286.wav|We have got no money to go anywhere.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_287.wav|I believe he could have turned it around.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_288.wav|The Believer isn't just a movie.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_289.wav|You are looking at him.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_290.wav|The best team won.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_291.wav|It being the weekend, there was no-one there.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_292.wav|It was an achievement all right.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_293.wav|They think that it matters but it doesn't.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_294.wav|He was pronounced dead in hospital.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_295.wav|It should be equal.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_296.wav|It will make a big difference.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_297.wav|I want to make a difference.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_298.wav|What was the cause of all this outrage?|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_299.wav|He will have it within two weeks.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_300.wav|How do you feel?|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_301.wav|It is a terrible state of affairs.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_302.wav|It was not the right time for me.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_303.wav|But they have the sound.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_304.wav|Not all women are dismayed.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_305.wav|There will have to be a full inquiry.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_306.wav|It is not just in Edinburgh.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_307.wav|It's never happened before.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_308.wav|It was a deeper deception.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_309.wav|Norton was delighted with his successes.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_310.wav|The figures are bad, but not that bad.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_311.wav|There is another side to it.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_312.wav|His remit is specific.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_313.wav|It will be very damaging for research.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_314.wav|I'm a bit overwhelmed.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_315.wav|The Old Firm are growing.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_316.wav|They want to win the title.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_317.wav|Her concerns were not without foundation.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_318.wav|This decision is a farce.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_319.wav|That would be the constructive way forward.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_320.wav|My view has now completely changed.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_321.wav|It was blown out of proportion.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_322.wav|You have no chance of planning permission.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_323.wav|That is taking place in Strathclyde.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_324.wav|He was in a mood.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_325.wav|Was this element always there?|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_326.wav|This is an awful lot of money.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_327.wav|He was the architect.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_328.wav|The United Nations must act.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_329.wav|They haven't got a hope.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_330.wav|He was a national treasure.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_331.wav|I think they are right to be impatient.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_332.wav|We need to regroup.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_333.wav|I must make that clear.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_334.wav|The board is currently resolving its differences.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_335.wav|I've never regretted coming here.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_336.wav|He is in a lot of pain, it is very distressing.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_337.wav|I just had to go for it.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_338.wav|It seems to go down well.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_339.wav|I am feeling on top of the world.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_341.wav|I don't know, really.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_343.wav|Therefore there is a threat.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_344.wav|She would love it.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_345.wav|One was taken to hospital.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_346.wav|You did not see it.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_347.wav|Gritty he did not want.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_348.wav|The world is being invited to visit.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_349.wav|Nobody was able to escape.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_350.wav|Surely the answer is yes.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_351.wav|Secondly, there is the question of money.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_352.wav|He was later deported.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_353.wav|I only found out about it this morning.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_354.wav|I am not sure.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_355.wav|One might think that it is a power.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_356.wav|This place is outstanding.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_357.wav|Obviously we want to stop the rot.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_358.wav|But it is a fact.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_359.wav|They never seem to do anything about it.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_360.wav|We're going to sleep.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_361.wav|It raises a serious question mark.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_362.wav|The work with Alison was a great experience.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_363.wav|It was great fun.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_364.wav|Experience in this work is paramount.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_365.wav|It has certainly not been an enjoyable experience.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_366.wav|It is not needed, it should go.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_367.wav|She had not suffered any physical injury.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_368.wav|We have a business to run.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_369.wav|We have been overwhelmed by the response.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_370.wav|And there are others.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_371.wav|However, it was well worth the wait.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_372.wav|I think we did well.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_373.wav|Only two things are certain.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_374.wav|There is nothing to fear.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_375.wav|Just look at his record.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_376.wav|He was a legend.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_377.wav|It is a memorial.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_378.wav|I have no evidence.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_379.wav|But is he?|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_380.wav|We were very unhappy with the incident.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_381.wav|The challenge is to win a cup.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_382.wav|It is something that we would support.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_383.wav|It was a double tragedy for the family.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_384.wav|We are in shock.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_385.wav|Does it really matter?|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_386.wav|I loved it - and so did my friend.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_387.wav|A decision is expected today.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_388.wav|I am enjoying it.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_389.wav|It wasn't very pretty to watch.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_390.wav|You have to go for it.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_391.wav|Are these immoral?|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_392.wav|It has been a massive success.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_393.wav|It is for the same reason.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_394.wav|The whole thing has been a nightmare.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_395.wav|Players are fighting to stay in the team.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_396.wav|He will have something to say.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_397.wav|You can't take a chance.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_398.wav|I'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_399.wav|There is a lack of logic.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_401.wav|We are about to have our own Parliament.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_402.wav|I am desperate to play for Scotland.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_403.wav|It is a large number.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_404.wav|She doesn't know where to begin.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_405.wav|This is your chance.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_406.wav|I'm not allowed to speak to anyone.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_407.wav|There's nothing she can't do.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_408.wav|Nicolson is no stranger to the Highlands.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_409.wav|I'd love the chance to play for Scotland.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_410.wav|Clearly the impact is going to be negative.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_411.wav|He died in September.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_412.wav|It was not even this century.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_413.wav|That was really tough.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_414.wav|It's not going to last five minutes.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_415.wav|I am happy with my form.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_416.wav|That's the name of the game, though.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_417.wav|With him are the symbols of his faith.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_418.wav|Overall, it has certainly worked out.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_419.wav|This is actually true.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_420.wav|Both were reduced to rubble.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_421.wav|It could have taken another two months.|105,,,,
wav48/p363/p363_422.wav|Hopefully, the answer is in the positive.|105,,,
wav48/p363/p363_423.wav|He said he had no reports of casualties.|105,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_001.wav|Please call Stella.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|106,,
wav48/p364/p364_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|106,,,
wav48/p364/p364_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|106,,,
wav48/p364/p364_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|106,,
wav48/p364/p364_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|106,,
wav48/p364/p364_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|106,,,
wav48/p364/p364_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|106,,,
wav48/p364/p364_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.|106,,,
wav48/p364/p364_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|106,,,
wav48/p364/p364_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|106,,
wav48/p364/p364_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|106,,
wav48/p364/p364_025.wav|Is that not pathetic?|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_026.wav|Our nation has been changed by this event.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_027.wav|That would be a big step forward.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_028.wav|I love you so very much.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_029.wav|Scotland needs to hear it, too.|106,,,
wav48/p364/p364_030.wav|Prime minister Blair is not that way.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_031.wav|But at the moment there isn't the budget.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_032.wav|It is not a matter of concern.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_033.wav|We're not either of those things.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_034.wav|The man has already had too many chances.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_035.wav|It shouldn't be a problem.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_036.wav|It was very moving, actually.|106,,,
wav48/p364/p364_037.wav|It isn't a free-for-all.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_038.wav|PENSIONS have been hitting the headlines.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_039.wav|I was not fit enough and it showed.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_040.wav|I thought it was the only way out.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_041.wav|We welcome the ministers decision.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_042.wav|Since then it has become a tradition.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_043.wav|The concept is simple.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_044.wav|That is how the Farmer is feeling today.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_045.wav|And that's the trouble with this business.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_046.wav|So what did he do?|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_047.wav|We must not give in to bastards.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_048.wav|The trial will open today.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_049.wav|But it didn't happen.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_050.wav|What do you think they said?|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_051.wav|There will be no disruption in the schools.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_053.wav|I can live with that.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_054.wav|There is no doubt about that.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_055.wav|The president took offence.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_056.wav|Our commitment is to move forward.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_057.wav|Partly, it is his own fault.|106,,,
wav48/p364/p364_058.wav|That's where it all started.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_059.wav|The family is so happy for him.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_060.wav|Why has it taken so long?|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_061.wav|No-one knows the numbers.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_062.wav|You make the choice.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_063.wav|It is not the fault of one man, of course.|106,,,
wav48/p364/p364_064.wav|I knew the script.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_065.wav|It's not going to work.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_066.wav|He leaves a beat.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_067.wav|Perhaps it was her demeanour.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_068.wav|I see no need to change.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_069.wav|It lasted longer than we thought.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_070.wav|They've got more time.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_071.wav|They made a huge impression on me.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_072.wav|There is no hiding place.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_073.wav|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_074.wav|This was a massive result for us.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_075.wav|It's not in my nature.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_076.wav|You see - this business is a good one.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_077.wav|Who is he?|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_078.wav|Scotland were on Saturday.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_079.wav|He wanted to talk to me about it.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_081.wav|That would be a big mistake.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_082.wav|No-one has spoken to me.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_083.wav|His arrival could be the making of them.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_084.wav|I was close enough.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_085.wav|He dismissed the action.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_086.wav|I said How much?|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_087.wav|I support the stand that they are making.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_088.wav|The couple had one daughter.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_089.wav|But was it really so big?|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_090.wav|Nature will not find its own level.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_091.wav|I didn't have the choice.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_092.wav|But this has already been rejected.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_094.wav|They have not seen her for years.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_095.wav|It was good to score the goal today.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_096.wav|Allison is not convinced.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_097.wav|He felt there was no case to answer.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_098.wav|This is a one-off.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_099.wav|He liked to talk.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_100.wav|Lots of others were doing the same.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_101.wav|It is still holding good today.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_102.wav|This takes the pressure off.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_103.wav|Our legal advice is clear.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_104.wav|But he has a lifeline.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_105.wav|This is a horrible loss.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_106.wav|Long-term, it was the right thing to do.|106,,,
wav48/p364/p364_107.wav|We are not leaving the area.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_108.wav|The airspace above the theatre was closed off.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_109.wav|Success in Scotland is important.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_110.wav|We could do a lot worse.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_111.wav|I know the worry over Iraq.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_112.wav|The outcome is now in our own hands.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_113.wav|It was just great.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_114.wav|You are always aware of the injury potential.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_115.wav|We don't know what is happening to them.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_116.wav|It's an old story.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_117.wav|It was an important part of the course.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_118.wav|It has been a great success.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_119.wav|I will be trying to do better tomorrow.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_120.wav|Who will take them after that?|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_121.wav|It is part of their job.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_122.wav|This decision is a victory for common sense.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_123.wav|One is too many.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_124.wav|What can you say?|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_125.wav|This means that our programme is quite unusual.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_126.wav|The money all appears to be gone.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_127.wav|He was extremely ill.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_128.wav|This time, it was not be.|106,,,
wav48/p364/p364_129.wav|They are unable to say anything.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_130.wav|The timing is wrong.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_131.wav|That's why he is a national treasure.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_132.wav|He just attracted people.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_133.wav|He will be fine.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_134.wav|I love a clever reader.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_135.wav|There will be no exceptions to this rule.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_136.wav|But he's a very quiet man.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_137.wav|Destruction came from within.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_138.wav|It's not their fault.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_140.wav|It won the match.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_141.wav|New investment will be openly tendered.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_142.wav|I'd never have called a doctor for myself.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_143.wav|It is sponsored by The Herald.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_144.wav|I don't entirely buy that.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_145.wav|It was the rugby writers dinner in London.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_146.wav|The casting of her husband was an accident.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_147.wav|I would say so.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_148.wav|I've had six days of rehearsal.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_149.wav|It's a good story.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_150.wav|Do not listen to them.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_151.wav|It was too soon.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_152.wav|It is an absolute disgrace.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_153.wav|I don't think it is the case.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_154.wav|Everyone would have been happy.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_155.wav|It has paid off.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_156.wav|Ferguson had done his homework.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_157.wav|He deserved that much.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_158.wav|We want to know about the policy.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_159.wav|Mr Blair defended his wife.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_160.wav|He has gone back to school.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_161.wav|It is not illegal.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_162.wav|I don't know where it went.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_163.wav|There was nothing anyone could do.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_164.wav|I don't want to use the term.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_165.wav|I really feel sorry for the Irish.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_166.wav|Now they have to do something about it.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_167.wav|The post will be unpaid.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_168.wav|One-third of the places are already taken.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_169.wav|I hope that doesn't happen.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_170.wav|It's all happening at a local level.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_171.wav|You will never replace the child.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_172.wav|We must do that.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_173.wav|England will be under a lot of pressure.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_174.wav|This has been fantastic.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_175.wav|I'm delighted for the lads.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_176.wav|I learned that only yesterday.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_177.wav|It's very very frustrating.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_178.wav|We want him to continue that way.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_179.wav|But he did not rule out further talks.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_180.wav|Our children are our future.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_181.wav|It's part of your life.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_182.wav|We will see how he is.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_183.wav|He had a horror.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_184.wav|So it was in politics.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_185.wav|There are two offerings from Scotland.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_187.wav|The matter has been reported to the police.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_188.wav|We are at war.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_189.wav|We do know the reaction of the SAC.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_190.wav|The state is controlled by the left.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_191.wav|The principle is quite clear.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_192.wav|Despite that, it was a great day for me.|106,,,
wav48/p364/p364_193.wav|I would say the risk is very small.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_194.wav|And there are different perspectives.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_195.wav|Mr Wallace was unimpressed.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_196.wav|I put the drawing down.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_197.wav|The hearing continues today.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_198.wav|You would be wrong.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_199.wav|On recent evidence, he will not be missed.|106,,,
wav48/p364/p364_200.wav|Police have refused to name the couple involved.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_201.wav|Our destiny is in our own hands.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_202.wav|The attitude was good today.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_203.wav|I've got nothing to say.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_204.wav|It requires a wider team.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_205.wav|It is so beautiful.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_206.wav|It is suitable and sensible.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_207.wav|In many ways it was disastrous.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_208.wav|I am really, really happy.|106,,,
wav48/p364/p364_209.wav|This is perfectly legal.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_210.wav|I'm not interested in money.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_211.wav|I'm looking forward to racing Donovan.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_212.wav|I can handle the pace.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_213.wav|I am happy to be here.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_214.wav|We are seeking a meeting with the Minister.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_215.wav|I believe it would have been successful.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_216.wav|It's better to be happy.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_217.wav|It's happened, but it's a dream.|106,,,
wav48/p364/p364_218.wav|I had a son.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_219.wav|It was very, very frightening.|106,,,
wav48/p364/p364_220.wav|That suggests that out fitness is good.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_221.wav|I had no choice.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_222.wav|What do you do.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_223.wav|It would also delay the Scottish results.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_224.wav|This one would have been.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_225.wav|We just have to improve.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_226.wav|It hasn't worked out that way.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_227.wav|This is very good news.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_228.wav|Is it a warning to parents?|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_229.wav|Everything is surrounded by confusion.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_230.wav|There is nothing wrong with that.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_231.wav|I could not believe the results.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_232.wav|What do you do?|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_233.wav|And there are some interesting conductors, too.|106,,,
wav48/p364/p364_234.wav|It was all over for us then.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_235.wav|They were assured that it would.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_236.wav|Thankfully they liked it.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_237.wav|I am very encouraged by this poll.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_238.wav|We just do not do it.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_239.wav|It was a long time coming.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_240.wav|It had happened to him.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_241.wav|That is our business.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_242.wav|We were completely outplayed.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_243.wav|The car driver was not injured.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_244.wav|It was a surprising decision.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_245.wav|Colin Cameron was excellent.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_246.wav|I believe in having difficult times.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_247.wav|Stand by for action.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_248.wav|It was something special.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_249.wav|He deserves a top team.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_250.wav|We just need the Government to act.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_251.wav|It was really surprising.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_252.wav|It was a nightmare.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_253.wav|But this is just the first step.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_254.wav|We can do it.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_255.wav|This is as bad as it gets.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_256.wav|The real issue is personal.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_257.wav|That can happen so easily.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_258.wav|We deserved to get the victory today.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_259.wav|That's the last thing he will do.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_260.wav|FIRST, we had the Battle of Britain.|106,,,
wav48/p364/p364_261.wav|It does not take much.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_262.wav|It would be a bonus for this game.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_263.wav|I've seen it work already.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_264.wav|Do you mean today?|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_265.wav|Israeli forces denied the claim.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_266.wav|This could be the case.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_267.wav|We try to keep it right.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_268.wav|I have got to keep the lid on.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_269.wav|Or so we thought.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_270.wav|For many, it had become a fact of life.|106,,,
wav48/p364/p364_271.wav|Last season was very hard for me.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_272.wav|It was a definite penalty.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_273.wav|It's great fun to get to act.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_274.wav|We are keen to have him back.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_275.wav|Horses have some sense.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_276.wav|It goes in cycles.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_277.wav|And now he has decided, enough.|106,,,
wav48/p364/p364_278.wav|Visiting fans were banned from attending the game.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_279.wav|He made no comment.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_280.wav|We have to get on with it.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_281.wav|He was at the game, and he is indeed.|106,,,
wav48/p364/p364_282.wav|It would be dangerous to resign.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_283.wav|It is a victory to that extent.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_284.wav|Clearly, the future remains uncertain.|106,,,
wav48/p364/p364_285.wav|I certainly hope so.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_286.wav|She died later on Monday.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_287.wav|It does and it doesn't.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_288.wav|It will not be today, though.|106,,,
wav48/p364/p364_289.wav|We suspect he was pleased.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_290.wav|I have been here for only three months.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_291.wav|We have no knowledge of this.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_292.wav|I was the willing journeyman.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_293.wav|I know we ask a lot of you.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_294.wav|When he got up he was hit again.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_297.wav|It was just one man.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_298.wav|It's going to be tough.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_299.wav|You will be very, very welcome.|106,,,
wav48/p364/p364_300.wav|I really want to win in Glasgow.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_301.wav|Is he any good?|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_302.wav|The proposals have been taken out of context.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_303.wav|It was then that Rangers scored.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_304.wav|This was repeated the second time.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_305.wav|I chose the former.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_306.wav|Sub Not Used, McKee.|106,,,
wav48/p364/p364_308.wav|They were very responsive.|106,,,,
wav48/p364/p364_309.wav|We're talking to him.|106,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_001.wav|Please call Stella.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_002.wav|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_003.wav|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|107,,
wav48/p374/p374_004.wav|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_005.wav|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_006.wav|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_007.wav|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_008.wav|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|107,,
wav48/p374/p374_009.wav|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|107,,
wav48/p374/p374_010.wav|People look, but no one ever finds it.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_011.wav|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_012.wav|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_013.wav|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_014.wav|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_015.wav|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_016.wav|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_017.wav|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_018.wav|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_019.wav|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_020.wav|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_021.wav|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_022.wav|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_023.wav|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|107,,
wav48/p374/p374_024.wav|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|107,,
wav48/p374/p374_025.wav|She had to learn a new discipline.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_026.wav|This isn't some form of commission.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_027.wav|The game today is certainly different.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_028.wav|We did it in one take.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_029.wav|I'll take the blame for that.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_030.wav|And that was just for starters.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_031.wav|In order to get there, we have got to invest.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_032.wav|Why did it take a concerted campaign?|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_033.wav|I will always remember the horrible images.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_034.wav|What you sow, you have to reap.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_035.wav|We are expecting a big crowd.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_036.wav|I was contacted this morning.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_037.wav|He didn't want me to leave the house.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_038.wav|It's not just a challenge for us.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_039.wav|But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_040.wav|I've had a ball.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_041.wav|Treatment is not an issue with these people.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_042.wav|YOU thought it was a headache.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_043.wav|I still hope to go.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_044.wav|Does that put pressure on us?|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_045.wav|As a player you have to move on.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_046.wav|It is so out of character.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_047.wav|I am inclined to play it down.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_048.wav|However, it's good to turn the page.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_049.wav|His condition was serious but stable.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_050.wav|He had reason to be pleased.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_051.wav|We have a problem.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_052.wav|I find it puzzling and disturbing.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_053.wav|That alibi is now gone.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_054.wav|But the cost to his health was enormous.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_055.wav|I suspect the latter.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_056.wav|However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.|107,,
wav48/p374/p374_057.wav|It is simple, really.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_058.wav|The net is closing.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_059.wav|I cannot believe she has been admonished.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_060.wav|That took a long time to happen.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_061.wav|It was on fire.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_062.wav|This year the exercise is being repeated.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_063.wav|Nobody did in those days.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_064.wav|You, the British people, are the boss.|107,,
wav48/p374/p374_065.wav|Where is the discipline?|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_066.wav|We were very much a happy family.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_067.wav|They won the trophy in the Hoops.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_068.wav|This time it is official.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_069.wav|It's going to be epic.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_070.wav|She could easily have been killed.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_071.wav|Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.|107,
wav48/p374/p374_072.wav|I didn't mean to kill her.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_073.wav|We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_074.wav|That money could have been coming to Scotland.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_075.wav|I'd love to do another Olympics.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_076.wav|What method of funding is being used?|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_077.wav|It is not a standing army.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_078.wav|This is a great day.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_079.wav|He got his degree.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_080.wav|I'm trying to be relaxed about the future.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_081.wav|and their remit is limited.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_082.wav|I have great respect for all my players.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_083.wav|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_084.wav|There is no question of dithering.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_085.wav|His track record is not promising.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_086.wav|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.|107,,
wav48/p374/p374_087.wav|It would be very dangerous.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_088.wav|Now it has been eclipsed.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_089.wav|Our numbers are small.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_090.wav|We have no idea what caused the derailment.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_091.wav|I am confident of the outcome this week.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_092.wav|It's not right of Labour.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_093.wav|It doesn't always work that way.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_094.wav|This was much worse.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_095.wav|That, though, is not true.|107,,
wav48/p374/p374_096.wav|I'm working at the moment.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_097.wav|However, this is only the start.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_098.wav|They might also be reviewed by their colleagues.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_099.wav|He loved it, and so did they.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_100.wav|I want to be there by right.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_101.wav|That was very important.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_102.wav|Two and a half million people have died.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_103.wav|I hope they understand that.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_104.wav|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_105.wav|It's a very, very special day.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_106.wav|Let that be their memorial.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_107.wav|We're all paying for it.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_108.wav|Lester was like that.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_109.wav|Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_110.wav|That is very, very bad news for our nation.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_111.wav|We were never told it was already decided.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_112.wav|It was a sickening sight.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_113.wav|We are at an advanced stage, and are now instructing counsel.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_114.wav|I don't think it would make any difference.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_115.wav|They have just got to believe in themselves.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_116.wav|If that is not a warning, what is it?|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_117.wav|I fell in love with it.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_118.wav|It ignores the future.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_119.wav|The quality of work is very impressive.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_120.wav|That's not going to happen again.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_121.wav|Paterson was the man.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_122.wav|The course is in great condition.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_123.wav|Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.|107,,
wav48/p374/p374_124.wav|It is too early to speculate.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_125.wav|It's up to them.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_126.wav|They went to the press.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_127.wav|I am happy to play for Aberdeen.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_128.wav|We are very pleased.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_129.wav|You're not going to get hurt.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_130.wav|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_131.wav|I was very fortunate.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_132.wav|It had been in place since last July.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_133.wav|Players want to know what is on offer.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_134.wav|They are a good team.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_135.wav|The contest was already over.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_136.wav|Does it make a profit?|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_137.wav|Now, that would impress the kids.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_138.wav|It was the only possible decision.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_139.wav|How much of a cop out is that?|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_140.wav|The whole region is in shock.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_141.wav|Where is the logic in that?|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_142.wav|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_143.wav|I told the players that at half-time.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_144.wav|I see the extended family once a year.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_145.wav|Why is this?|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_146.wav|It was indeed a night to remember.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_147.wav|Raymond was always on the outside.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_148.wav|There is something in this.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_149.wav|And so it should.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_150.wav|News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_151.wav|They may differ on other issues.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_152.wav|That's the important thing.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_153.wav|But opinion was divided.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_154.wav|Next league matches Motherwell.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_155.wav|I have been there already.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_156.wav|My wife is totally behind me on this.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_157.wav|Scott and Emily were so happy.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_158.wav|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_159.wav|But every two minutes it was exploding.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_160.wav|And sooner than we may think.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_161.wav|It is a step up.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_162.wav|You probably have never seen them before.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_163.wav|However, it is not all bad news for women.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_164.wav|We're very proud of him and his achievement.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_165.wav|Something has got to change.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_166.wav|I made a mistake.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_167.wav|I'd never given up on myself.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_168.wav|That prevented any recurrence of the problem.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_169.wav|That's the kind of production it was.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_170.wav|Little girls are his victims.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_171.wav|It is not for me, though.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_172.wav|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_173.wav|The rest is his own.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_174.wav|The statement was a lie.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_175.wav|It is the manager's decision.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_176.wav|It was a day for records.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_177.wav|The Government has to grasp the nettle.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_178.wav|There's no reason for panic.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_179.wav|We have got away with it.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_180.wav|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_181.wav|I was doing well at the hustings.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_182.wav|He had planned to sell it.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_183.wav|It was just one of those days.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_184.wav|But it did not last.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_185.wav|She has been unable to work since.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_186.wav|No-one has ever seen inside.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_187.wav|I know nothing about that.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_188.wav|We have not given up.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_189.wav|Archer is no newcomer to the stage.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_190.wav|It's a matter of time.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_191.wav|The number never came.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_192.wav|You encourage them - you can do it.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_193.wav|The winner will be announced by early summer.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_194.wav|This is the New Edinburgh.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_195.wav|The stadium was full.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_196.wav|There isn't much of a scene in Austria.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_197.wav|Perhaps it is jealousy.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_198.wav|His name is Michael Owen.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_199.wav|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.|107,,
wav48/p374/p374_200.wav|I didn't want to ignore the punters.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_201.wav|This hasn't happened in a vacuum.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_202.wav|I foolishly had done nothing about it.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_203.wav|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_204.wav|It was so unfair.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_205.wav|Smith has not let him down.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_206.wav|They have to be dealt with.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_207.wav|Glasgow is a friendly city.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_208.wav|No, it's actually in a block of flats.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_209.wav|They were that poor.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_210.wav|It was an odd affair, in many respects.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_211.wav|Stan is a vital part of our future.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_212.wav|We're very close to being a good team.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_213.wav|All these things have an impact.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_214.wav|I thought their commitment was superb.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_215.wav|I'm really proud of my young players.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_216.wav|There was great support all round the route.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_217.wav|I had nothing to lose.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_218.wav|That is just not true.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_219.wav|History is made at the Masters.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_220.wav|This is not a European Army.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_221.wav|Not so, he insisted.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_222.wav|All of the names are familiar to me.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_223.wav|I wonder what they listen to?|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_224.wav|Does a lot of drawing.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_225.wav|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_226.wav|There are moments of honesty, too.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_227.wav|He is doing just that.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_228.wav|The night is young.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_229.wav|That is bad enough.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_230.wav|We used to keep our business rates.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_231.wav|I suspect that it will.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_232.wav|We need to think.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_233.wav|We are very happy with the verdict.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_234.wav|They want it to work.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_235.wav|For once it wasn't about money.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_236.wav|It's not the end of the matter, of course.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_237.wav|That doesn't happen in Europe.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_238.wav|Jackson may well be right.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_239.wav|Then it was the turn of the carnival.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_240.wav|He's very, very lucky to be alive.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_241.wav|It's always somebody else's.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_242.wav|It could now be up to the courts.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_243.wav|We can make a difference.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_244.wav|This was not a contest.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_245.wav|It is just so sad.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_246.wav|Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_247.wav|This was not an easy meeting for me.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_248.wav|It all depends on the Chancellor.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_249.wav|I get very excited by that.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_250.wav|The members have clearly spoken.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_251.wav|It was not pretty.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_252.wav|It was like a scene from the Holocaust.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_253.wav|Which means it matters.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_254.wav|This is certainly not the case.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_255.wav|There is great potential on this river.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_256.wav|It's very difficult to find a buyer.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_257.wav|Our thoughts are with his family.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_258.wav|It is a technique.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_259.wav|The court has not decided.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_260.wav|I feel sorry for the Reds.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_261.wav|I just want to get rid of it.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_262.wav|I have not come in to take over.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_263.wav|Is this accurate?|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_264.wav|But what did it matter?|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_265.wav|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|107,,
wav48/p374/p374_266.wav|I am expecting to win.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_267.wav|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_268.wav|I was an athlete.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_269.wav|We don't need to change the law.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_270.wav|All of us do.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_271.wav|Three months or so later, they are returning.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_272.wav|That is partly true, but there are ways of doing it.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_273.wav|We can only do that for so long.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_274.wav|He got very close tonight.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_275.wav|I don't know why you say goodbye.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_276.wav|It is our other home.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_277.wav|Where do you start?|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_278.wav|At the end of the day, two men have been shot.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_279.wav|It was the first time they met.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_280.wav|I am also delighted for all the players.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_281.wav|We are delighted with that.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_282.wav|He did very well, but didn't win.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_283.wav|And we're not there yet.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_284.wav|People don't feel safe, including me.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_285.wav|Later we discovered it was a hoax.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_286.wav|They want to shut the Scottish Office.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_287.wav|It is something that we will put right.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_288.wav|I had a good life at Rangers.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_289.wav|Perhaps we should do the same.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_290.wav|He's very good at relating to adults.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_291.wav|It opened last month.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_292.wav|Just a year later he was dead.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_293.wav|You must be ready to play anyone.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_294.wav|This is a club on the rise.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_295.wav|I had a sense of deja vu.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_296.wav|That was the theory, anyway.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_297.wav|I don't know them or anything.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_298.wav|I couldn't make out what was going on.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_299.wav|That's what we're trying to achieve.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_300.wav|Because we do not need it.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_301.wav|The atmosphere is businesslike.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_302.wav|They use them for everything.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_303.wav|I've already got this.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_304.wav|There's a story, too.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_305.wav|There have been different reports from different people.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_306.wav|But it has all been worthwhile.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_307.wav|But that's another story for another day.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_308.wav|It was a foolhardy decision.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_309.wav|This is as bad as it can get.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_310.wav|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?|107,,
wav48/p374/p374_311.wav|It was just awful.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_312.wav|There was a hell of a row.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_313.wav|We are satisfied with this outcome.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_314.wav|I am not a threat to coaches.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_315.wav|It's never over until it's over.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_316.wav|He had been a singer.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_317.wav|I was very pleased with them today, though.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_318.wav|If you're going to do it, do it right.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_319.wav|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_320.wav|No one was listening.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_321.wav|It's not one for the purists.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_322.wav|It may now be too expensive for anyone.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_323.wav|It really is good to be back.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_324.wav|We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_325.wav|It will never happen.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_326.wav|We cannot go on like this.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_327.wav|The biggest thing is structure.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_328.wav|This could be a recipe for conflict.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_329.wav|This is great news for us.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_330.wav|We certainly have to try something.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_331.wav|SO now we know the secret.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_332.wav|Harrowing is easy, after all.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_333.wav|What is that?|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_334.wav|We just want them home.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_335.wav|And we have beaten them before.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_336.wav|He has two children.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_337.wav|That is the fact of the matter.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_338.wav|It was a matter of choice.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_339.wav|And that's good news for the magpies.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_340.wav|But we can't have a casino.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_341.wav|I'm looking forward to that.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_342.wav|So what is their secret?|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_343.wav|It's a great idea.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_344.wav|It was not being marketed properly.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_345.wav|I have been struggling with my form.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_346.wav|That was about it.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_347.wav|It is coming on very well.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_348.wav|We won't go down without a struggle.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_349.wav|By hard work, is the answer.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_350.wav|We were unlucky not to score.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_351.wav|I did not have a bet on myself.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_352.wav|As if they ever stopped.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_353.wav|And that brings us to the point.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_354.wav|Clark is back on top form.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_355.wav|But happily, the story is true.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_356.wav|It does seem a mystery.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_357.wav|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.|107,,
wav48/p374/p374_358.wav|It's for that reason he should resign.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_359.wav|It's a good start.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_360.wav|One person had a broken back.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_361.wav|I hope that is the lucky break.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_362.wav|It is almost like a family.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_363.wav|But when we do it is great.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_364.wav|I disagree entirely with the decision.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_365.wav|My game is coming back.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_366.wav|It was a game they could have won.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_367.wav|Then came the collision with Sergio.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_368.wav|It is a matter for Westminster.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_369.wav|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_370.wav|I can't believe the buzz.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_371.wav|Sport is good for you.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_372.wav|I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_373.wav|This is not a struggle against Islam.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_374.wav|This is the goal.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_375.wav|The mood was euphoric.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_376.wav|I want to get at the truth.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_377.wav|Everyone here is very sad.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_378.wav|It was located on the remote control.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_379.wav|I am not changing my mind.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_380.wav|Is something which we just don't do.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_381.wav|He was taken ill in his office.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_382.wav|It is, though the law is not clear cut.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_383.wav|It's the only thing.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_384.wav|Two others were also seriously injured.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_385.wav|What's the best thing to do?|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_386.wav|For tragedy it is.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_387.wav|I'm trying to stay open on that.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_388.wav|Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_389.wav|It was good today.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_390.wav|We are all very pleased.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_391.wav|The hotel was huge.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_392.wav|These days are over.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_393.wav|They do it properly.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_394.wav|Well, you can have a tree.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_395.wav|I just don't know what she was doing.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_396.wav|However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.|107,
wav48/p374/p374_397.wav|You can't have both.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_398.wav|That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_399.wav|I was influenced by all of these things.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_400.wav|You do not change overnight.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_401.wav|Or so it seemed.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_402.wav|I will have to think about it.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_403.wav|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_404.wav|Well, you can't have everything.|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_405.wav|They have not given them the evidence.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_406.wav|We need to chat.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_407.wav|We are obviously disturbed by this case.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_408.wav|That was never their agenda.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_409.wav|I certainly will not settle.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_410.wav|He said it was the worst possible result.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_411.wav|It's very tragic and traumatic.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_412.wav|It's always the same, isn't it?|107,,,
wav48/p374/p374_413.wav|I don't make it mystical.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_414.wav|So what was he really doing?|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_415.wav|Neither could be contacted last night.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_416.wav|That clearly wasn't what they wanted.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_417.wav|Some old favourites remain in varying forms.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_418.wav|And well he might.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_419.wav|They have not been named.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_420.wav|It feels like too much.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_421.wav|This is the last thing we ever expected.|107,,,,
wav48/p374/p374_422.wav|Next year this time we will be home.|107,,,,
